LETTER the FIRST<br/>
From ISABEL to LAURA</h2>

<p>
How often, in answer to my repeated intreaties that you would give my Daughter
a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of your Life, have you said
&ldquo;No, my freind never will I comply with your request till I may be no
longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Surely that time is now at hand. You are this day 55. If a woman may ever be
said to be in safety from the determined Perseverance of disagreeable Lovers
and the cruel Persecutions of obstinate Fathers, surely it must be at such a
time of Life.

<p>
Altho&rsquo; I cannot agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be
exposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced, yet to
avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature, I will gratify the curiosity
of your daughter; and may the fortitude with which I have suffered the many
afflictions of my past Life, prove to her a useful lesson for the support of
those which may befall her in her own.

LETTER 3rd<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE</h2>

<p>
As the Daughter of my most intimate freind I think you entitled to that
knowledge of my unhappy story, which your Mother has so often solicited me to
give you.
</p>

<p>
My Father was a native of Ireland and an inhabitant of Wales; my Mother was the
natural Daughter of a Scotch Peer by an italian Opera-girl&mdash;I was born in
Spain and received my Education at a Convent in France.
</p>

<p>
When I had reached my eighteenth Year I was recalled by my Parents to my
paternal roof in Wales. Our mansion was situated in one of the most romantic
parts of the Vale of Uske. Tho&rsquo; my Charms are now considerably softened
and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone, I was once
beautiful. But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were the least of my
Perfections. Of every accomplishment accustomary to my sex, I was Mistress.
When in the Convent, my progress had always exceeded my instructions, my
Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age, and I had shortly surpassed my
Masters.
</p>

<p>
In my Mind, every Virtue that could adorn it was centered; it was the
Rendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment.
</p>

<p>
A sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my Freinds, my
Acquaintance and particularly to every affliction of my own, was my only fault,
if a fault it could be called. Alas! how altered now! Tho&rsquo; indeed my own
Misfortunes do not make less impression on me than they ever did, yet now I
never feel for those of an other. My accomplishments too, begin to fade&mdash;I
can neither sing so well nor Dance so gracefully as I once did&mdash;and I have
entirely forgot the <i>Minuet Dela Cour</i>.

LETTER 4th<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE</h2>

<p>
Our neighbourhood was small, for it consisted only of your Mother. She may
probably have already told you that being left by her Parents in indigent
Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical motives. There it was
our freindship first commenced. Isobel was then one and twenty. Tho&rsquo;
pleasing both in her Person and Manners (between ourselves) she never possessed
the hundredth part of my Beauty or Accomplishments. Isabel had seen the World.
She had passed 2 Years at one of the first Boarding-schools in London; had
spent a fortnight in Bath and had supped one night in Southampton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beware my Laura (she would often say) Beware of the insipid Vanities and
idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England; Beware of the unmeaning
Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas! (exclaimed I) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never be
exposed to? What probability is there of my ever tasting the Dissipations of
London, the Luxuries of Bath, or the stinking Fish of Southampton? I who am
doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an humble Cottage in the Vale of
Uske.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ah! little did I then think I was ordained so soon to quit that humble Cottage
for the Deceitfull Pleasures of the World.

LETTER 5th<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE</h2>

<p>
One Evening in December as my Father, my Mother and myself, were arranged in
social converse round our Fireside, we were on a sudden greatly astonished, by
hearing a violent knocking on the outward door of our rustic Cot.
</p>

<p>
My Father started&mdash;&ldquo;What noise is that,&rdquo; (said he.) &ldquo;It
sounds like a loud rapping at the door&rdquo;&mdash;(replied my Mother.)
&ldquo;it does indeed.&rdquo; (cried I.) &ldquo;I am of your opinion; (said my
Father) it certainly does appear to proceed from some uncommon violence exerted
against our unoffending door.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes (exclaimed I) I cannot help
thinking it must be somebody who knocks for admittance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine on
what motive the person may knock&mdash;tho&rsquo; that someone <i>does</i> rap
at the door, I am partly convinced.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here, a 2d tremendous rap interrupted my Father in his speech, and somewhat
alarmed my Mother and me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had we better not go and see who it is? (said she) the servants are
out.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think we had.&rdquo; (replied I.) &ldquo;Certainly, (added
my Father) by all means.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall we go now?&rdquo; (said my
Mother,) &ldquo;The sooner the better.&rdquo; (answered he.) &ldquo;Oh! let no
time be lost&rdquo; (cried I.)
</p>

<p>
A third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears. &ldquo;I am
certain there is somebody knocking at the Door.&rdquo; (said my Mother.)
&ldquo;I think there must,&rdquo; (replied my Father) &ldquo;I fancy the
servants are returned; (said I) I think I hear Mary going to the Door.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it (cried my Father) for I long to know who it
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was right in my conjecture; for Mary instantly entering the Room, informed us
that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door, who had lossed their
way, were very cold and begged leave to warm themselves by our fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you admit them?&rdquo; (said I.) &ldquo;You have no
objection, my Dear?&rdquo; (said my Father.) &ldquo;None in the World.&rdquo;
(replied my Mother.)
</p>

<p>
Mary, without waiting for any further commands immediately left the room and
quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable Youth, I had ever
beheld. The servant she kept to herself.
</p>

<p>
My natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the sufferings of
the unfortunate stranger and no sooner did I first behold him, than I felt that
on him the happiness or Misery of my future Life must depend.

LETTER 6th<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE</h2>

<p>
The noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay&mdash;for particular
reasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot. He told us that he was
the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for many years no more
and that he had a Sister of the middle size. &ldquo;My Father (he continued) is
a mean and mercenary wretch&mdash;it is only to such particular freinds as this
Dear Party that I would thus betray his failings. Your Virtues my amiable
Polydore (addressing himself to my father) yours Dear Claudia and yours my
Charming Laura call on me to repose in you, my confidence.&rdquo; We bowed.
&ldquo;My Father seduced by the false glare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of
Title, insisted on my giving my hand to Lady Dorothea. No never exclaimed I.
Lady Dorothea is lovely and Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir,
that I scorn to marry her in compliance with your Wishes. No! Never shall it be
said that I obliged my Father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We all admired the noble Manliness of his reply. He continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir Edward was surprised; he had perhaps little expected to meet with so
spirited an opposition to his will. &ldquo;Where, Edward in the name of wonder
(said he) did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish? You have been studying
Novels I suspect.&rdquo; I scorned to answer: it would have been beneath my
dignity. I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful William set forth for
my Aunts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My Father&rsquo;s house is situated in Bedfordshire, my Aunt&rsquo;s in
Middlesex, and tho&rsquo; I flatter myself with being a tolerable proficient in
Geography, I know not how it happened, but I found myself entering this
beautifull Vale which I find is in South Wales, when I had expected to have
reached my Aunts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After having wandered some time on the Banks of the Uske without knowing
which way to go, I began to lament my cruel Destiny in the bitterest and most
pathetic Manner. It was now perfectly dark, not a single star was there to
direct my steps, and I know not what might have befallen me had I not at length
discerned thro&rsquo; the solemn Gloom that surrounded me a distant light,
which as I approached it, I discovered to be the chearfull Blaze of your fire.
Impelled by the combination of Misfortunes under which I laboured, namely Fear,
Cold and Hunger I hesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have
gained; and now my Adorable Laura (continued he taking my Hand) when may I hope
to receive that reward of all the painfull sufferings I have undergone during
the course of my attachment to you, to which I have ever aspired. Oh! when will
you reward me with Yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This instant, Dear and Amiable Edward.&rdquo; (replied I.). We were
immediately united by my Father, who tho&rsquo; he had never taken orders had
been bred to the Church.

LETTER 7th<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE</h2>

<p>
We remained but a few days after our Marriage, in the Vale of Uske. After
taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my Isabel, I
accompanied Edward to his Aunt&rsquo;s in Middlesex. Philippa received us both
with every expression of affectionate Love. My arrival was indeed a most
agreable surprise to her as she had not only been totally ignorant of my
Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had the slightest idea of there
being such a person in the World.
</p>

<p>
Augusta, the sister of Edward was on a visit to her when we arrived. I found
her exactly what her Brother had described her to be&mdash;of the middle size.
She received me with equal surprise though not with equal Cordiality, as
Philippa. There was a disagreable coldness and Forbidding Reserve in her
reception of me which was equally distressing and Unexpected. None of that
interesting Sensibility or amiable simpathy in her manners and Address to me
when we first met which should have distinguished our introduction to each
other. Her Language was neither warm, nor affectionate, her expressions of
regard were neither animated nor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive
me to her Heart, tho&rsquo; my own were extended to press her to mine.
</p>

<p>
A short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I accidentally
overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me that her Heart was no
more formed for the soft ties of Love than for the endearing intercourse of
Freindship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this
imprudent connection?&rdquo; (said Augusta.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Augusta (replied the noble Youth) I thought you had a better opinion of
me, than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider my
Father&rsquo;s Concurrence in any of my affairs, either of Consequence or
concern to me. Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know me consult his
inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling Particular since the
age of fifteen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Edward (replied she) you are surely too diffident in your own praise.
Since you were fifteen only! My Dear Brother since you were five years old, I
entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the satisfaction of
your Father. But still I am not without apprehensions of your being shortly
obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by seeking a support for your wife
in the Generosity of Sir Edward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never, never Augusta will I so demean myself. (said Edward). Support!
What support will Laura want which she can receive from him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink.&rdquo;
(answered she.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Victuals and Drink! (replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous
Manner) and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for an
exalted mind (such as is my Laura&rsquo;s) than the mean and indelicate
employment of Eating and Drinking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None that I know of, so efficacious.&rdquo; (returned Augusta).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta?
(replied my Edward). Does it appear impossible to your vile and corrupted
Palate, to exist on Love? Can you not conceive the Luxury of living in every
distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of your tenderest
affection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are too ridiculous (said Augusta) to argue with; perhaps however you
may in time be convinced that...&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech, by the
appearance of a very Handsome young Woman, who was ushured into the Room at the
Door of which I had been listening. On hearing her announced by the Name of
&ldquo;Lady Dorothea,&rdquo; I instantly quitted my Post and followed her into
the Parlour, for I well remembered that she was the Lady, proposed as a Wife
for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet.
</p>

<p>
Altho&rsquo; Lady Dorothea&rsquo;s visit was nominally to Philippa and Augusta,
yet I have some reason to imagine that (acquainted with the Marriage and
arrival of Edward) to see me was a principal motive to it.
</p>

<p>
I soon perceived that tho&rsquo; Lovely and Elegant in her Person and
tho&rsquo; Easy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of
Beings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined
Sensibility, of which Augusta was one.
</p>

<p>
She staid but half an hour and neither in the Course of her Visit, confided to
me any of her secret thoughts, nor requested me to confide in her, any of Mine.
You will easily imagine therefore my Dear Marianne that I could not feel any
ardent affection or very sincere Attachment for Lady Dorothea.

LETTER 8th<br/>
LAURA to MARIANNE, in continuation</h2>

<p>
Lady Dorothea had not left us long before another visitor as unexpected a one
as her Ladyship, was announced. It was Sir Edward, who informed by Augusta of
her Brother&rsquo;s marriage, came doubtless to reproach him for having dared
to unite himself to me without his Knowledge. But Edward foreseeing his design,
approached him with heroic fortitude as soon as he entered the Room, and
addressed him in the following Manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir Edward, I know the motive of your Journey here&mdash;You come with
the base Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble
engagement with my Laura without your Consent. But Sir, I glory in the
Act&mdash;. It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of my
Father!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So saying, he took my hand and whilst Sir Edward, Philippa, and Augusta were
doubtless reflecting with admiration on his undaunted Bravery, led me from the
Parlour to his Father&rsquo;s Carriage which yet remained at the Door and in
which we were instantly conveyed from the pursuit of Sir Edward.
</p>

<p>
The Postilions had at first received orders only to take the London road; as
soon as we had sufficiently reflected However, we ordered them to Drive to
M&mdash;&mdash;. the seat of Edward&rsquo;s most particular freind, which was
but a few miles distant.
</p>

<p>
At M&mdash;&mdash;. we arrived in a few hours; and on sending in our names were
immediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward&rsquo;s freind. After having
been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for such I term
your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most truly worthy of the
Name. Sophia was rather above the middle size; most elegantly formed. A soft
languor spread over her lovely features, but increased their Beauty&mdash;. It
was the Charectarestic of her Mind&mdash;. She was all sensibility and Feeling.
We flew into each others arms and after having exchanged vows of mutual
Freindship for the rest of our Lives, instantly unfolded to each other the most
inward secrets of our Hearts&mdash;. We were interrupted in the delightfull
Employment by the entrance of Augustus, (Edward&rsquo;s freind) who was just
returned from a solitary ramble.
</p>

<p>
Never did I see such an affecting Scene as was the meeting of Edward and
Augustus.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My Life! my Soul!&rdquo; (exclaimed the former) &ldquo;My adorable
angel!&rdquo; (replied the latter) as they flew into each other&rsquo;s arms.
It was too pathetic for the feelings of Sophia and myself&mdash;We fainted
alternately on a sofa.

LETTER the 9th<br/>
From the same to the same</h2>

<p>
Towards the close of the day we received the following Letter from Philippa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has taken
back Augusta to Bedfordshire. Much as I wish to enjoy again your charming
society, I cannot determine to snatch you from that, of such dear and deserving
Freinds&mdash;When your Visit to them is terminated, I trust you will return to
the arms of your&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Philippa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after thanking her
for her kind invitation assured her that we would certainly avail ourselves of
it, whenever we might have no other place to go to. Tho&rsquo; certainly
nothing could to any reasonable Being, have appeared more satisfactory, than so
gratefull a reply to her invitation, yet I know not how it was, but she was
certainly capricious enough to be displeased with our behaviour and in a few
weeks after, either to revenge our Conduct, or releive her own solitude,
married a young and illiterate Fortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho&rsquo;
we were sensible that it would probably deprive us of that fortune which
Philippa had ever taught us to expect) could not on our own accounts, excite
from our exalted minds a single sigh; yet fearfull lest it might prove a source
of endless misery to the deluded Bride, our trembling Sensibility was greatly
affected when we were first informed of the Event. The affectionate Entreaties
of Augustus and Sophia that we would for ever consider their House as our Home,
easily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them. In the society of
my Edward and this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest moments of my Life; Our
time was most delightfully spent, in mutual Protestations of Freindship, and in
vows of unalterable Love, in which we were secure from being interrupted, by
intruding and disagreable Visitors, as Augustus and Sophia had on their first
Entrance in the Neighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding
Families, that as their happiness centered wholly in themselves, they wished
for no other society. But alas! my Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then
enjoyed was too perfect to be lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow at
once destroyed every sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be from what
I have already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that there never were a
happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that their union had been
contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel and Mercenery Parents; who had
vainly endeavoured with obstinate Perseverance to force them into a Marriage
with those whom they had ever abhorred; but with a Heroic Fortitude worthy to
be related and admired, they had both, constantly refused to submit to such
despotic Power.
</p>

<p>
After having so nobly disentangled themselves from the shackles of Parental
Authority, by a Clandestine Marriage, they were determined never to forfeit the
good opinion they had gained in the World, in so doing, by accepting any
proposals of reconciliation that might be offered them by their
Fathers&mdash;to this farther tryal of their noble independance however they
never were exposed.
</p>

<p>
They had been married but a few months when our visit to them commenced during
which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of money which
Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father&rsquo;s Escritoire,
a few days before his union with Sophia.
</p>

<p>
By our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho&rsquo; their
means for supplying them were then nearly exhausted. But they, Exalted
Creatures! scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and would
have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.&mdash;Alas! what was their
Reward for such disinterested Behaviour! The beautifull Augustus was arrested
and we were all undone. Such perfidious Treachery in the merciless perpetrators
of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest Marianne as much as it then
affected the Delicate sensibility of Edward, Sophia, your Laura, and of
Augustus himself. To compleat such unparalelled Barbarity we were informed that
an Execution in the House would shortly take place. Ah! what could we do but
what we did! We sighed and fainted on the sofa.

<p>
When we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering Effusions of our grief,
Edward desired that we would consider what was the most prudent step to be
taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his imprisoned freind to
lament over his misfortunes. We promised that we would, and he set forwards on
his journey to Town. During his absence we faithfully complied with his Desire
and after the most mature Deliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we
could do was to leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers
of Justice to take possession. We waited therefore with the greatest
impatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the result of
our Deliberations. But no Edward appeared. In vain did we count the tedious
moments of his absence&mdash;in vain did we weep&mdash;in vain even did we
sigh&mdash;no Edward returned&mdash;. This was too cruel, too unexpected a Blow
to our Gentle Sensibility&mdash;we could not support it&mdash;we could only
faint. At length collecting all the Resolution I was Mistress of, I arose and
after packing up some necessary apparel for Sophia and myself, I dragged her to
a Carriage I had ordered and we instantly set out for London. As the Habitation
of Augustus was within twelve miles of Town, it was not long e&rsquo;er we
arrived there, and no sooner had we entered Holboun than letting down one of
the Front Glasses I enquired of every decent-looking Person that we passed
&ldquo;If they had seen my Edward?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated Enquiries, I
gained little, or indeed, no information concerning him. &ldquo;Where am I to
drive?&rdquo; said the Postilion. &ldquo;To Newgate Gentle Youth (replied I),
to see Augustus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot go to
Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus in so cruel a
confinement&mdash;my feelings are sufficiently shocked by the <i>recital</i>,
of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my Sensibility.&rdquo; As I
perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her Sentiments the Postilion was
instantly directed to return into the Country. You may perhaps have been
somewhat surprised my Dearest Marianne, that in the Distress I then endured,
destitute of any support, and unprovided with any Habitation, I should never
once have remembered my Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of
Uske. To account for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a
trifling circumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned. The
death of my Parents a few weeks after my Departure, is the circumstance I
allude to. By their decease I became the lawfull Inheritress of their House and
Fortune. But alas! the House had never been their own and their Fortune had
only been an Annuity on their own Lives. Such is the Depravity of the World! To
your Mother I should have returned with Pleasure, should have been happy to
have introduced to her, my charming Sophia and should with Chearfullness have
passed the remainder of my Life in their dear Society in the Vale of Uske, had
not one obstacle to the execution of so agreable a scheme, intervened; which
was the Marriage and Removal of your Mother to a distant part of Ireland.

<p>
&ldquo;I have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London) who
I am certain would not hesitate in receiving me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I order
the Boy to drive there?&rdquo; said I&mdash;but instantly recollecting myself,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the
Horses.&rdquo; Unwilling however to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge
of the Strength and Abilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was
entirely of my Opinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined to change
Horses at the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of the Journey&mdash;.
When we arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which was but a few miles
from the House of Sophia&rsquo;s Relation, unwilling to intrude our Society on
him unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very elegant and well penned Note
to him containing an account of our Destitute and melancholy Situation, and of
our intention to spend some months with him in Scotland. As soon as we had
dispatched this Letter, we immediately prepared to follow it in person and were
stepping into the Carriage for that Purpose when our attention was attracted by
the Entrance of a coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman
considerably advanced in years descended from it. At his first Appearance my
Sensibility was wonderfully affected and e&rsquo;er I had gazed at him a 2d
time, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that he was my
Grandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my conjecture I
instantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and following the
Venerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I threw myself on my
knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me as his Grand Child. He
started, and having attentively examined my features, raised me from the Ground
and throwing his Grandfatherly arms around my Neck, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Acknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance of my Laurina and Laurina&rsquo;s
Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my Claudia&rsquo;s Mother, I do
acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and the Grandaughter of the
other.&rdquo; While he was thus tenderly embracing me, Sophia astonished at my
precipitate Departure, entered the Room in search of me. No sooner had she
caught the eye of the venerable Peer, than he exclaimed with every mark of
Astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;Another Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you are the
Daughter of my Laurina&rsquo;s eldest Girl; your resemblance to the beauteous
Matilda sufficiently proclaims it. &ldquo;Oh! replied Sophia,
when I first beheld you the instinct of Nature whispered me that we were
in some degree related&mdash;But whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could
not pretend to determine.&rdquo; He folded her in his arms, and whilst they
were tenderly embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most beautifull
young Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started and retreating
back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, &ldquo;Another Grand-child! What
an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the space of 3 minutes, as many
of my Descendants! This I am certain is Philander the son of my Laurina&rsquo;s
3d girl the amiable Bertha; there wants now but the presence of Gustavus to
compleat the Union of my Laurina&rsquo;s Grand-Children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And here he is; (said a Gracefull Youth who that instant entered the
room) here is the Gustavus you desire to see. I am the son of Agatha your
Laurina&rsquo;s 4th and youngest Daughter,&rdquo; &ldquo;I see you are indeed;
replied Lord St. Clair&mdash;But tell me (continued he looking fearfully
towards the Door) tell me, have I any other Grand-children in the House.&rdquo;
&ldquo;None my Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will provide for you all without
farther delay&mdash;Here are 4 Banknotes of 50£ each&mdash;Take them and
remember I have done the Duty of a Grandfather.&rdquo; He instantly left the
Room and immediately afterwards the House.

LETTER the 12th<br/>
LAURA in continuation</h2>

<p>
You may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure of Lord
St Clair. &ldquo;Ignoble Grand-sire!&rdquo; exclaimed Sophia. &ldquo;Unworthy
Grandfather!&rdquo; said I, and instantly fainted in each other&rsquo;s arms.
How long we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered we
found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the Banknotes. As
we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the Apartment opened and
&ldquo;Macdonald&rdquo; was announced. He was Sophia&rsquo;s cousin. The haste
with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt of our Note, spoke
so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to pronounce him at first sight,
a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas! he little deserved the name&mdash;for
though he told us that he was much concerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own
account it appeared that the perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a
single sigh, nor induced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive
stars&mdash;. He told Sophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with
him to Macdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin&rsquo;s freind he should be happy
to see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were received
with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and the Mistress of
the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally well disposed, endowed
with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic Disposition, she might, had these
amiable qualities been properly encouraged, have been an ornament to human
Nature; but unfortunately her Father possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted
to admire so promising a Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his
power to prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far
extinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail on her
to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They were to be
married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when we arrived.
<i>We</i> soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man as one might
have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he was Sensible,
well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge of such trifles, but
as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had never read the sorrows of
Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least resemblance to auburn, we were
certain that Janetta could feel no affection for him, or at least that she
ought to feel none. The very circumstance of his being her father&rsquo;s
choice too, was so much in his disfavour, that had he been deserving her, in
every other respect yet <i>that</i> of itself ought to have been a sufficient
reason in the Eyes of Janetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were
determined to represent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting
with the desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in
the affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own opinion,
and a suitable contempt of her father&rsquo;s. We found her indeed all that our
warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty to convince her that
it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it was her Duty to disobey her
Father; the only thing at which she rather seemed to hesitate was our assertion
that she must be attached to some other Person. For some time, she persevered
in declaring that she knew no other young man for whom she had the the smallest
Affection; but upon explaining the impossibility of such a thing she said that
she beleived she <i>did like</i> Captain M&rsquo;Kenrie better than any one she
knew besides. This confession satisfied us and after having enumerated the good
Qualities of M&rsquo;Kenrie and assured her that she was violently in love with
him, we desired to know whether he had ever in any wise declared his affection
to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that he
has ever felt any for me.&rdquo; said Janetta. &ldquo;That he certainly adores
you (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt&mdash;. The Attachment must be
reciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration&mdash;tenderly press your
hand&mdash;drop an involantary tear&mdash;and leave the room abruptly?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Never (replied she) that I remember&mdash;he has always left the room
indeed when his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly
abruptly or without making a bow.&rdquo; Indeed my Love (said I) you must be
mistaken&mdash;for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left
you but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a moment
Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose that he could
ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.&rdquo; Having settled this
Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into consideration was, to
determine in what manner we should inform M&rsquo;Kenrie of the favourable
Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at length agreed to acquaint him with
it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew up in the following manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! happy Lover of the beautifull Janetta, oh! amiable Possessor of
<i>her</i> Heart whose hand is destined to another, why do you thus delay a
confession of your attachment to the amiable Object of it? Oh! consider that a
few weeks will at once put an end to every flattering Hope that you may now
entertain, by uniting the unfortunate Victim of her father&rsquo;s Cruelty to
the execrable and detested Graham.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas! why do you thus so cruelly connive at the projected Misery of her
and of yourself by delaying to communicate that scheme which had doubtless long
possessed your imagination? A secret Union will at once secure the felicity of
both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The amiable M&rsquo;Kenrie, whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had been
the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of his affection
for Janetta, on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of Love to
Macdonald-Hall, and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her who inspired
it, that after a few more private interveiws, Sophia and I experienced the
satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green, which they chose for the
celebration of their Nuptials, in preference to any other place although it was
at a considerable distance from Macdonald-Hall.

LETTER the 13th<br/>
LAURA in continuation</h2>

<p>
They had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or Graham
had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not even then have
suspected it, but for the following little Accident. Sophia happening one day
to open a private Drawer in Macdonald&rsquo;s Library with one of her own keys,
discovered that it was the Place where he kept his Papers of consequence and
amongst them some bank notes of considerable amount. This discovery she
imparted to me; and having agreed together that it would be a proper treatment
of so vile a Wretch as Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly
gained, it was determined that the next time we should either of us happen to
go that way, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from the drawer. This
well meant Plan we had often successfully put in Execution; but alas! on the
very day of Janetta&rsquo;s Escape, as Sophia was majestically removing the 5th
Bank-note from the Drawer to her own purse, she was suddenly most impertinently
interrupted in her employment by the entrance of Macdonald himself, in a most
abrupt and precipitate Manner. Sophia (who though naturally all winning
sweetness could when occasions demanded it call forth the Dignity of her sex)
instantly put on a most forbidding look, and darting an angry frown on the
undaunted culprit, demanded in a haughty tone of voice &ldquo;Wherefore her
retirement was thus insolently broken in on?&rdquo; The unblushing Macdonald,
without even endeavouring to exculpate himself from the crime he was charged
with, meanly endeavoured to reproach Sophia with ignobly defrauding him of his
money... The dignity of Sophia was wounded; &ldquo;Wretch (exclaimed she,
hastily replacing the Bank-note in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of
an Act, of which the bare idea makes me blush?&rdquo; The base wretch was still
unconvinced and continued to upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such
opprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle sweetness
of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by informing him of
Janetta&rsquo;s Elopement, and of the active Part we had both taken in the
affair. At this period of their Quarrel I entered the Library and was as you
may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the ill-grounded accusations of the
malevolent and contemptible Macdonald. &ldquo;Base Miscreant! (cried I) how
canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to sully the spotless reputation of such
bright Excellence? Why dost thou not suspect <i>my</i> innocence as
soon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Be satisfied Madam (replied he) I <i>do</i> suspect it, and
therefore must desire that you will both leave this House in less than half an
hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall go willingly; (answered Sophia) our hearts have long detested
thee, and nothing but our freindship for thy Daughter could have induced us to
remain so long beneath thy roof.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your Freindship for my Daughter has indeed been most powerfully exerted
by throwing her into the arms of an unprincipled Fortune-hunter.&rdquo;
(replied he)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, (exclaimed I) amidst every misfortune, it will afford us some
consolation to reflect that by this one act of Freindship to Janetta, we have
amply discharged every obligation that we have received from her father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must indeed be a most gratefull reflection, to your exalted
minds.&rdquo; (said he.)
</p>

<p>
As soon as we had packed up our wardrobe and valuables, we left Macdonald Hall,
and after having walked about a mile and a half we sate down by the side of a
clear limpid stream to refresh our exhausted limbs. The place was suited to
meditation. A grove of full-grown Elms sheltered us from the East&mdash;. A Bed
of full-grown Nettles from the West&mdash;. Before us ran the murmuring brook
and behind us ran the turn-pike road. We were in a mood for contemplation and
in a Disposition to enjoy so beautifull a spot. A mutual silence which had for
some time reigned between us, was at length broke by my
exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;What a lovely scene! Alas why are not Edward and
Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties with us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! my beloved Laura (cried Sophia) for pity&rsquo;s sake forbear
recalling to my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband.
Alas, what would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus! to know if he is
still in Newgate, or if he is yet hung. But never shall I be able so far to
conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him. Oh! do not I beseech you
ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name&mdash;. It affects me too
deeply&mdash;. I cannot bear to hear him mentioned it wounds my
feelings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me my Sophia for having thus unwillingly offended
you&mdash;&rdquo; replied I&mdash;and then changing the conversation, desired
her to admire the noble Grandeur of the Elms which sheltered us from the
Eastern Zephyr. &ldquo;Alas! my Laura (returned she) avoid so melancholy a
subject, I intreat you. Do not again wound my Sensibility by observations on
those elms. They remind me of Augustus. He was like them, tall,
magestic&mdash;he possessed that noble grandeur which you admire in
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was silent, fearfull lest I might any more unwillingly distress her by fixing
on any other subject of conversation which might again remind her of Augustus.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you not speak my Laura? (said she after a short pause) &ldquo;I
cannot support this silence you must not leave me to my own reflections; they
ever recur to Augustus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a beautifull sky! (said I) How charmingly is the azure varied by
those delicate streaks of white!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! my Laura (replied she hastily withdrawing her Eyes from a momentary
glance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to an object
which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus&rsquo;s blue sattin waistcoat
striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind avoid a subject so
distressing.&rdquo; What could I do? The feelings of Sophia were at that time
so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for Augustus so poignant that I had
not power to start any other topic, justly fearing that it might in some
unforseen manner again awaken all her sensibility by directing her thoughts to
her Husband. Yet to be silent would be cruel; she had intreated me to talk.
</p>

<p>
From this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly apropos;
it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman&rsquo;s Phaeton, on the road which
ran murmuring behind us. It was a most fortunate accident as it diverted the
attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections which she had been before
indulging. We instantly quitted our seats and ran to the rescue of those who
but a few moments before had been in so elevated a situation as a fashionably
high Phaeton, but who were now laid low and sprawling in the Dust. &ldquo;What
an ample subject for reflection on the uncertain Enjoyments of this World,
would not that Phaeton and the Life of Cardinal Wolsey afford a thinking
Mind!&rdquo; said I to Sophia as we were hastening to the field of Action.
</p>

<p>
She had not time to answer me, for every thought was now engaged by the horrid
spectacle before us. Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired but weltering in
their blood was what first struck our Eyes&mdash;we approached&mdash;they were
Edward and Augustus&mdash;. Yes dearest Marianne they were our Husbands. Sophia
shreiked and fainted on the ground&mdash;I screamed and instantly ran
mad&mdash;. We remained thus mutually deprived of our senses, some minutes, and
on regaining them were deprived of them again. For an Hour and a Quarter did we
continue in this unfortunate situation&mdash;Sophia fainting every moment and I
running mad as often. At length a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone
retained any share of life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before
imagined that either of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our
Greif&mdash;but as we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no
more, we knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about. No
sooner did we therefore hear my Edward&rsquo;s groan than postponing our
lamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and kneeling on
each side of him implored him not to die&mdash;. &ldquo;Laura (said He fixing
his now languid Eyes on me) I fear I have been overturned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was overjoyed to find him yet sensible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! tell me Edward (said I) tell me I beseech you before you die, what
has befallen you since that unhappy Day in which Augustus was arrested and we
were separated&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will&rdquo; (said he) and instantly fetching a deep sigh,
Expired&mdash;. Sophia immediately sank again into a swoon&mdash;. <i>My</i>
greif was more audible. My Voice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, my
face became as pale as Death, and my senses were considerably impaired&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Talk not to me of Phaetons (said I, raving in a frantic, incoherent
manner)&mdash;Give me a violin&mdash;. I&rsquo;ll play to him and sooth him in
his melancholy Hours&mdash;Beware ye gentle Nymphs of Cupid&rsquo;s
Thunderbolts, avoid the piercing shafts of Jupiter&mdash;Look at that grove of
Firs&mdash;I see a Leg of Mutton&mdash;They told me Edward was not Dead; but
they deceived me&mdash;they took him for a cucumber&mdash;&rdquo; Thus I
continued wildly exclaiming on my Edward&rsquo;s Death&mdash;. For two Hours
did I rave thus madly and should not then have left off, as I was not in the
least fatigued, had not Sophia who was just recovered from her swoon, intreated
me to consider that Night was now approaching and that the Damps began to fall.
&ldquo;And whither shall we go (said I) to shelter us from either?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To that white Cottage.&rdquo; (replied she pointing to a neat Building
which rose up amidst the grove of Elms and which I had not before
observed&mdash;) I agreed and we instantly walked to it&mdash;we knocked at the
door&mdash;it was opened by an old woman; on being requested to afford us a
Night&rsquo;s Lodging, she informed us that her House was but small, that she
had only two Bedrooms, but that However we should be wellcome to one of them.
We were satisfied and followed the good woman into the House where we were
greatly cheered by the sight of a comfortable fire&mdash;. She was a widow and
had only one Daughter, who was then just seventeen&mdash;One of the best of
ages; but alas! she was very plain and her name was Bridget..... Nothing
therfore could be expected from her&mdash;she could not be supposed to possess
either exalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities&mdash;. She
was nothing more than a mere good-tempered, civil and obliging young woman; as
such we could scarcely dislike here&mdash;she was only an Object of
Contempt&mdash;.

LETTER the 14th<br/>
LAURA in continuation</h2>

<p>
Arm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are Mistress
of; summon up all the fortitude you possess, for alas! in the perusal of the
following Pages your sensibility will be most severely tried. Ah! what were the
misfortunes I had before experienced and which I have already related to you,
to the one I am now going to inform you of. The Death of my Father and my
Mother and my Husband though almost more than my gentle Nature could support,
were trifles in comparison to the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The
morning after our arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain
in her delicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake. She attributed
it to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the Dew was
falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably the case; since
how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should have escaped the same
indisposition, but by supposing that the bodily Exertions I had undergone in my
repeated fits of frenzy had so effectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to
make me proof against the chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying
totally inactive on the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I
was most seriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to
you, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End be fatal
to her.
</p>

<p>
Alas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually worse&mdash;and
I daily became more alarmed for her. At length she was obliged to confine
herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy Landlady&mdash;. Her
disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few days carried her off.
Amidst all my Lamentations for her (and violent you may suppose they were) I
yet received some consolation in the reflection of my having paid every
attention to her, that could be offered, in her illness. I had wept over her
every Day&mdash;had bathed her sweet face with my tears and had pressed her
fair Hands continually in mine&mdash;. &ldquo;My beloved Laura (said she to me
a few Hours before she died) take warning from my unhappy End and avoid the
imprudent conduct which had occasioned it... Beware of fainting-fits... Though
at the time they may be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the
end, if too often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your
Constitution... My fate will teach you this.. I die a Martyr to my greif for
the loss of Augustus.. One fatal swoon has cost me my Life.. Beware of swoons
Dear Laura.... A frenzy fit is not one quarter so pernicious; it is an exercise
to the Body and if not too violent, is I dare say conducive to Health in its
consequences&mdash;Run mad as often as you chuse; but do not
faint&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
These were the last words she ever addressed to me.. It was her dieing Advice
to her afflicted Laura, who has ever most faithfully adhered to it.
</p>

<p>
After having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave, I immediately
(tho&rsquo; late at night) left the detested Village in which she died, and
near which had expired my Husband and Augustus. I had not walked many yards
from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach, in which I instantly took a
place, determined to proceed in it to Edinburgh, where I hoped to find some
kind some pitying Freind who would receive and comfort me in my afflictions.
</p>

<p>
It was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish the Number
of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were many. Regardless
however of anything concerning them, I gave myself up to my own sad
Reflections. A general silence prevailed&mdash;A silence, which was by nothing
interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of the Party.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an illiterate villain must that man be! (thought I to myself) What
a total want of delicate refinement must he have, who can thus shock our senses
by such a brutal noise! He must I am certain be capable of every bad action!
There is no crime too black for such a Character!&rdquo; Thus reasoned I within
myself, and doubtless such were the reflections of my fellow travellers.
</p>

<p>
At length, returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel who
had so violently disturbed my feelings. It was Sir Edward the father of my
Deceased Husband. By his side sate Augusta, and on the same seat with me were
your Mother and Lady Dorothea. Imagine my surprise at finding myself thus
seated amongst my old Acquaintance. Great as was my astonishment, it was yet
increased, when on looking out of Windows, I beheld the Husband of Philippa,
with Philippa by his side, on the Coachbox and when on looking behind I beheld,
Philander and Gustavus in the Basket. &ldquo;Oh! Heavens, (exclaimed I) is it
possible that I should so unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations
and Connections?&rdquo; These words roused the rest of the Party, and every eye
was directed to the corner in which I sat. &ldquo;Oh! my Isabel (continued I
throwing myself across Lady Dorothea into her arms) receive once more to your
Bosom the unfortunate Laura. Alas! when we last parted in the Vale of Usk, I
was happy in being united to the best of Edwards; I had then a Father and a
Mother, and had never known misfortunes&mdash;But now deprived of every freind
but you&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! (interrupted Augusta) is my Brother dead then? Tell us I intreat
you what is become of him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, cold and insensible Nymph,
(replied I) that luckless swain your Brother, is no more, and you may now glory
in being the Heiress of Sir Edward&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Although I had always despised her from the Day I had overheard her
conversation with my Edward, yet in civility I complied with hers and Sir
Edward&rsquo;s intreaties that I would inform them of the whole melancholy
affair. They were greatly shocked&mdash;even the obdurate Heart of Sir Edward
and the insensible one of Augusta, were touched with sorrow, by the unhappy
tale. At the request of your Mother I related to them every other misfortune
which had befallen me since we parted. Of the imprisonment of Augustus and the
absence of Edward&mdash;of our arrival in Scotland&mdash;of our unexpected
Meeting with our Grand-father and our cousins&mdash;of our visit to
Macdonald-Hall&mdash;of the singular service we there performed towards
Janetta&mdash;of her Fathers ingratitude for it.. of his inhuman Behaviour,
unaccountable suspicions, and barbarous treatment of us, in obliging us to
leave the House.. of our lamentations on the loss of Edward and Augustus and
finally of the melancholy Death of my beloved Companion.
</p>

<p>
Pity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother&rsquo;s countenance,
during the whole of my narration, but I am sorry to say, that to the eternal
reproach of her sensibility, the latter infinitely predominated. Nay, faultless
as my conduct had certainly been during the whole course of my late misfortunes
and adventures, she pretended to find fault with my behaviour in many of the
situations in which I had been placed. As I was sensible myself, that I had
always behaved in a manner which reflected Honour on my Feelings and
Refinement, I paid little attention to what she said, and desired her to
satisfy my Curiosity by informing me how she came there, instead of wounding my
spotless reputation with unjustifiable Reproaches. As soon as she had complyed
with my wishes in this particular and had given me an accurate detail of every
thing that had befallen her since our separation (the particulars of which if
you are not already acquainted with, your Mother will give you) I applied to
Augusta for the same information respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady
Dorothea.
</p>

<p>
She told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature, her
curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part of the
World had been so much raised by Gilpin&rsquo;s Tour to the Highlands, that she
had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and had persuaded
Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they had arrived at Edinburgh a few Days
before and from thence had made daily Excursions into the Country around in the
Stage Coach they were then in, from one of which Excursions they were at that
time returning. My next enquiries were concerning Philippa and her Husband, the
latter of whom I learned having spent all her fortune, had recourse for
subsistence to the talent in which, he had always most excelled, namely,
Driving, and that having sold every thing which belonged to them except their
Coach, had converted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his
former Acquaintance, had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to Sterling
every other Day. That Philippa still retaining her affection for her
ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him
in his little Excursions to Sterling. &ldquo;It has only been to throw a little
money into their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my Father has always
travelled in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the Country since our arrival
in Scotland&mdash;for it would certainly have been much more agreable to us, to
visit the Highlands in a Postchaise than merely to travel from Edinburgh to
Sterling and from Sterling to Edinburgh every other Day in a crowded and
uncomfortable Stage.&rdquo; I perfectly agreed with her in her sentiments on
the affair, and secretly blamed Sir Edward for thus sacrificing his
Daughter&rsquo;s Pleasure for the sake of a ridiculous old woman whose folly in
marrying so young a man ought to be punished. His Behaviour however was
entirely of a peice with his general Character; for what could be expected from
a man who possessed not the smallest atom of Sensibility, who scarcely knew the
meaning of simpathy, and who actually snored&mdash;.

LETTER the 15th<br/>
LAURA in continuation.</h2>

<p>
When we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was determined to
speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as soon as I left the
Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after their Health,
expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation. At first they seemed
rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt that I might call them to
account for the money which our Grandfather had left me and which they had
unjustly deprived me of, but finding that I mentioned nothing of the Matter,
they desired me to step into the Basket as we might there converse with greater
ease. Accordingly I entered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring
green tea and buttered toast, we feasted ourselves in a more refined and
sentimental Manner by a confidential Conversation. I informed them of every
thing which had befallen me during the course of my life, and at my request
they related to me every incident of theirs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters which
Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers could neither
of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it is generally beleived
that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones a Bricklayer and that my Father
was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of Edinburgh. This is however of little
consequence for as our Mothers were certainly never married to either of them
it reflects no Dishonour on our Blood, which is of a most ancient and
unpolluted kind. Bertha (the Mother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother)
always lived together. They were neither of them very rich; their united
fortunes had originally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had
always lived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to
nine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one of the
Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the convenience of having
it always at Hand. Whether it was from this circumstance, of its being easily
taken, or from a wish of being independant, or from an excess of sensibility
(for which we were always remarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is
that when we had reached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran
away. Having obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with economy
and not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this purpose we
therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we devoted to Victuals,
the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th to Carriages, the 5th to
Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to Amusements, the 8th to Cloathes and the
9th to Silver Buckles. Having thus arranged our Expences for two months (for we
expected to make the nine Hundred Pounds last as long) we hastened to London
and had the good luck to spend it in 7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner
than we had intended. As soon as we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves
from the weight of so much money, we began to think of returning to our
Mothers, but accidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death, we gave
over the design and determined to engage ourselves to some strolling Company of
Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage. Accordingly we offered our
services to one and were accepted; our Company was indeed rather small, as it
consisted only of the Manager his wife and ourselves, but there were fewer to
pay and the only inconvenience attending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for
want of People to fill the Characters, we could perform. We did not mind
trifles however&mdash;. One of our most admired Performances was
<i>Macbeth</i>, in which we were truly great. The Manager always played
<i>Banquo</i> himself, his Wife my <i>Lady Macbeth</i>. I did the <i>Three
Witches</i> and Philander acted <i>all the rest</i>. To say the truth this
tragedy was not only the Best, but the only Play that we ever performed; and
after having acted it all over England, and Wales, we came to Scotland to
exhibit it over the remainder of Great Britain. We happened to be quartered in
that very Town, where you came and met your Grandfather&mdash;. We were in the
Inn-yard when his Carriage entered and perceiving by the arms to whom it
belonged, and knowing that Lord St Clair was our Grandfather, we agreed to
endeavour to get something from him by discovering the Relationship&mdash;. You
know how well it succeeded&mdash;. Having obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we
instantly left the Town, leaving our Manager and his Wife to act <i>Macbeth</i>
by themselves, and took the road to Sterling, where we spent our little fortune
with great <i>eclat</i>. We are now returning to Edinburgh in order to get some
preferment in the Acting way; and such my Dear Cousin is our History.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I thanked the amiable Youth for his entertaining narration, and after
expressing my wishes for their Welfare and Happiness, left them in their little
Habitation and returned to my other Freinds who impatiently expected me.
</p>

<p>
My adventures are now drawing to a close my dearest Marianne; at least for the
present.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his son,
he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year. I graciously
promised that I would, but could not help observing that the unsimpathetic
Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow of Edward than in
being the refined and amiable Laura.
</p>

<p>
I took up my Residence in a Romantic Village in the Highlands of Scotland where
I have ever since continued, and where I can uninterrupted by unmeaning Visits,
indulge in a melancholy solitude, my unceasing Lamentations for the Death of my
Father, my Mother, my Husband and my Freind.
</p>

<p>
Augusta has been for several years united to Graham the Man of all others most
suited to her; she became acquainted with him during her stay in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Sir Edward in hopes of gaining an Heir to his Title and Estate, at the same
time married Lady Dorothea&mdash;. His wishes have been answered.
</p>

<p>
Philander and Gustavus, after having raised their reputation by their
Performances in the Theatrical Line at Edinburgh, removed to Covent Garden,
where they still exhibit under the assumed names of <i>Luvis</i> and
<i>Quick</i>.
</p>

<p>
Philippa has long paid the Debt of Nature, Her Husband however still continues
to drive the Stage-Coach from Edinburgh to Sterling:&mdash;

LETTER the FIRST is from<br/>
Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Lesley Castle Janry 3rd&mdash;1792.
</p>

<p>
My Brother has just left us. &ldquo;Matilda (said he at parting) you and
Margaret will I am certain take all the care of my dear little one, that she
might have received from an indulgent, and affectionate and amiable
Mother.&rdquo; Tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these words&mdash;the
remembrance of her, who had so wantonly disgraced the Maternal character and so
openly violated the conjugal Duties, prevented his adding anything farther; he
embraced his sweet Child and after saluting Matilda and Me hastily broke from
us and seating himself in his Chaise, pursued the road to Aberdeen. Never was
there a better young Man! Ah! how little did he deserve the misfortunes he has
experienced in the Marriage state. So good a Husband to so bad a Wife! for you
know my dear Charlotte that the Worthless Louisa left him, her Child and
reputation a few weeks ago in company with Danvers and dishonour. Never was
there a sweeter face, a finer form, or a less amiable Heart than Louisa owned!
Her child already possesses the personal Charms of her unhappy Mother! May she
inherit from her Father all his mental ones! Lesley is at present but five and
twenty, and has already given himself up to melancholy and Despair; what a
difference between him and his Father! Sir George is 57 and still remains the
Beau, the flighty stripling, the gay Lad, and sprightly Youngster, that his Son
was really about five years back, and that <i>he</i> has affected to appear
ever since my remembrance. While our father is fluttering about the streets of
London, gay, dissipated, and Thoughtless at the age of 57, Matilda and I
continue secluded from Mankind in our old and Mouldering Castle, which is
situated two miles from Perth on a bold projecting Rock, and commands an
extensive veiw of the Town and its delightful Environs. But tho&rsquo; retired
from almost all the World, (for we visit no one but the M&rsquo;Leods, The
M&rsquo;Kenzies, the M&rsquo;Phersons, the M&rsquo;Cartneys, the
M&rsquo;Donalds, The M&rsquo;kinnons, the M&rsquo;lellans, the M&rsquo;kays,
the Macbeths and the Macduffs) we are neither dull nor unhappy; on the contrary
there never were two more lively, more agreable or more witty girls, than we
are; not an hour in the Day hangs heavy on our Hands. We read, we work, we
walk, and when fatigued with these Employments releive our spirits, either by a
lively song, a graceful Dance, or by some smart bon-mot, and witty repartee. We
are handsome my dear Charlotte, very handsome and the greatest of our
Perfections is, that we are entirely insensible of them ourselves. But why do I
thus dwell on myself! Let me rather repeat the praise of our dear little Neice
the innocent Louisa, who is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle Nap, as she
reposes on the sofa. The dear Creature is just turned of two years old; as
handsome as tho&rsquo; 2 and 20, as sensible as tho&rsquo; 2 and 30, and as
prudent as tho&rsquo; 2 and 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you that
she has a very fine complexion and very pretty features, that she already knows
the two first letters in the Alphabet, and that she never tears her
frocks&mdash;. If I have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense and
Prudence, I have nothing more to urge in support of my assertion, and you will
therefore have no way of deciding the Affair but by coming to Lesley-Castle,
and by a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine for yourself. Ah! my dear
Freind, how happy should I be to see you within these venerable Walls! It is
now four years since my removal from School has separated me from you; that two
such tender Hearts, so closely linked together by the ties of simpathy and
Freindship, should be so widely removed from each other, is vastly moving. I
live in Perthshire, You in Sussex. We might meet in London, were my Father
disposed to carry me there, and were your Mother to be there at the same time.
We might meet at Bath, at Tunbridge, or anywhere else indeed, could we but be
at the same place together. We have only to hope that such a period may arrive.
My Father does not return to us till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in
a few Days; he is impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters
himself that change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You will
join with me I am certain my dear Charlotte, in prayers for the recovery of the
unhappy Lesley&rsquo;s peace of Mind, which must ever be essential to that of
your sincere freind

LETTER the SECOND<br/>
From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY in answer.</h2>

<p>
Glenford Febry 12
</p>

<p>
I have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you my
dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should not have
deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the last five weeks been
so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for my sisters wedding, as to
allow me no time to devote either to you or myself. And now what provokes me
more than anything else is that the Match is broke off, and all my Labour
thrown away. Imagine how great the Dissapointment must be to me, when you
consider that after having laboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get
the Wedding dinner ready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef,
Broiled Mutton, and Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through
the Honey-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting,
Broiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose. Indeed my dear
Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I experienced on
last Monday when my sister came running to me in the store-room with her face
as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me that Hervey had been thrown from his
Horse, had fractured his Scull and was pronounced by his surgeon to be in the
most emminent Danger. &ldquo;Good God! (said I) you dont say so? Why what in
the name of Heaven will become of all the Victuals! We shall never be able to
eat it while it is good. However, we&rsquo;ll call in the Surgeon to help us. I
shall be able to manage the Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and
You and the Doctor must finish the rest.&rdquo; Here I was interrupted, by
seeing my poor Sister fall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests,
where we keep our Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the Maids,
and at last we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible,
she expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry, and was so wildly
bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest Difficulty in the World to
prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by Force than
Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid her upon the Bed, and
she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful Convulsions. My Mother and I
continued in the room with her, and when any intervals of tolerable Composure
in Eloisa would allow us, we joined in heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful
Waste in our provisions which this Event must occasion, and in concerting some
plan for getting rid of them. We agreed that the best thing we could do was to
begin eating them immediately, and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and
Fowls, and instantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity. We
would have persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken, but she would
not be persuaded. She was however much quieter than she had been; the
convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost perfect
Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our power, but to
no purpose. I talked to her of Henry. &ldquo;Dear Eloisa (said I) there&rsquo;s
no occasion for your crying so much about such a trifle. (for I was willing to
make light of it in order to comfort her) I beg you would not mind it&mdash;You
see it does not vex me in the least; though perhaps I may suffer most from it
after all; for I shall not only be obliged to eat up all the Victuals I have
dressed already, but must if Henry should recover (which however is not very
likely) dress as much for you again; or should he die (as I suppose he will) I
shall still have to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry any one else.
So you see that tho&rsquo; perhaps for the present it may afflict you to think
of Henry&rsquo;s sufferings, Yet I dare say he&rsquo;ll die soon, and then his
pain will be over and you will be easy, whereas my Trouble will last much
longer for work as hard as I may, I am certain that the pantry cannot be
cleared in less than a fortnight.&rdquo; Thus I did all in my power to console
her, but without any effect, and at last as I saw that she did not seem to
listen to me, I said no more, but leaving her with my Mother I took down the
remains of The Ham and Chicken, and sent William to ask how Henry did. He was
not expected to live many Hours; he died the same day. We took all possible
care to break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the tenderest manner; yet in
spite of every precaution, her sufferings on hearing it were too violent for
her reason, and she continued for many hours in a high Delirium. She is still
extremely ill, and her Physicians are greatly afraid of her going into a
Decline. We are therefore preparing for Bristol, where we mean to be in the
course of the next week. And now my dear Margaret let me talk a little of your
affairs; and in the first place I must inform you that it is confidently
reported, your Father is going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so
unpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I have
written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning it, which as
she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give me. I know not who is
the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely right in the resolution he has
taken of travelling, as it will perhaps contribute to obliterate from his
remembrance, those disagreable Events, which have lately so much afflicted
him&mdash;I am happy to find that tho&rsquo; secluded from all the World,
neither you nor Matilda are dull or unhappy&mdash;that you may never know what
it is to, be either is the wish of your sincerely affectionate

You could not have applied for information concerning the report of Sir George

LETTER the THIRD<br/>
From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C. LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Lesley Castle February the 16th
</p>

<p>
I <i>have</i> made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my Dear
Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were. I reflected that
if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a second family, our fortunes
must be considerably diminushed&mdash;that if his Wife should be of an
extravagant turn, she would encourage him to persevere in that gay and
Dissipated way of Life to which little encouragement would be necessary, and
which has I fear already proved but too detrimental to his health and
fortune&mdash;that she would now become Mistress of those Jewels which once
adorned our Mother, and which Sir George had always promised us&mdash;that if
they did not come into Perthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity
of beholding my Mother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit
at the head of her Father&rsquo;s table&mdash;. These my dear Charlotte were
the melancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing
Susan&rsquo;s letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she
had perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately occupied
her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most, whether the
probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own Consequence. We both wish very
much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what is your opinion of her;
as you honour her with the appellation of your freind, we flatter ourselves
that she must be amiable. My Brother is already in Paris. He intends to quit it
in a few Days, and to begin his route to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull
manner, says that the air of France has greatly recovered both his Health and
Spirits; that he has now entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree
either of Pity or Affection, that he even feels himself obliged to her for her
Elopement, as he thinks it very good fun to be single again. By this, you may
perceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety, and sprightly Wit,
for which he was once so remarkable. When he first became acquainted with
Louisa which was little more than three years ago, he was one of the most
lively, the most agreable young Men of the age&mdash;. I beleive you never yet
heard the particulars of his first acquaintance with her. It commenced at our
cousin Colonel Drummond&rsquo;s; at whose house in Cumberland he spent the
Christmas, in which he attained the age of two and twenty. Louisa Burton was
the Daughter of a distant Relation of Mrs. Drummond, who dieing a few Months
before in extreme poverty, left his only Child then about eighteen to the
protection of any of his Relations who would protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the
only one who found herself so disposed&mdash;Louisa was therefore removed from
a miserable Cottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from
every pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant Enjoyment
that Money could purchase&mdash;. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered and
Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition, under the
appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too well knew, that to
be married, would be the only chance she would have of not being starved, and
who flattered himself that with such an extroidinary share of personal beauty,
joined to a gentleness of Manners, and an engaging address, she might stand a
good chance of pleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without
a Shilling. Louisa perfectly entered into her father&rsquo;s schemes and was
determined to forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of
Perseverance and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised her
natural disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to impose
upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with her discovered
her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless Lesley first beheld her at
Drummond-house. His heart which (to use your favourite comparison) was as
delicate as sweet and as tender as a Whipt-syllabub, could not resist her
attractions. In a very few Days, he was falling in love, shortly after actually
fell, and before he had known her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at
first highly displeased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he
found that they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the
match. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty of his
great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient to support him
and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the first twelvemonth, no one could be
happier than Lesley, and no one more amiable to appearance than Louisa, and so
plausibly did she act and so cautiously behave that tho&rsquo; Matilda and I
often spent several weeks together with them, yet we neither of us had any
suspicion of her real Disposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one
would have thought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she
had so long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then
thought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did indeed appear
if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she seemed to take no pains to
prevent that affection from ever diminushing. Our visits therefore to Dunbeath,
were now less frequent and by far less agreable than they used to be. Our
absence was however never either mentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the
society of young Danvers with whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at
one of the Universities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda
and your freind, tho&rsquo; there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we
are. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not repeat
it&mdash;. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned anything
of the matter, I hope you will do me the justice to beleive that I <i>think</i>
and <i>feel</i>, a great deal for your Sisters affliction. I do not doubt but
that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely remove it, by erasing
from her Mind the remembrance of Henry. I am my dear Charlotte yrs ever

<h2><a name="link2H_4_0022"></a>
LETTER the FOURTH<br/>
From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY</h2>

<p>
Bristol February 27th
</p>

<p>
My Dear Peggy</p>

<p>
I have but just received your letter, which being directed to Sussex while I
was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here, and from some
unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me&mdash;. I return you many
thanks for the account it contains of Lesley&rsquo;s acquaintance, Love and
Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less entertained me for having often
been repeated to me before.
</p>

<p>
I have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to imagine
our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left Particular orders with
the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could, and to call in a couple of
Chairwomen to assist them. We brought a cold Pigeon pye, a cold turkey, a cold
tongue, and half a dozen Jellies with us, which we were lucky enough with the
help of our Landlady, her husband, and their three children, to get rid of, in
less than two days after our arrival. Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent
both in Health and Spirits, that I very much fear, the air of the Bristol
downs, healthy as it is, has not been able to drive poor Henry from her
remembrance.
</p>

<p>
You ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable&mdash;I will
now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms. She is
short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a good deal; has
fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let you know as soon as she
sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is remarkably good-tempered when
she has her own way, and very lively when she is not out of humour. She is
naturally extravagant and not very affected; she never reads anything but the
letters she receives from me, and never writes anything but her answers to
them. She plays, sings and Dances, but has no taste for either, and excells in
none, tho&rsquo; she says she is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may
flatter me so far as to be surprised that one of whom I speak with so little
affection should be my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our
freindship arose rather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine. We spent
two or three days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened
to be connected&mdash;. During our visit, the Weather being remarkably bad, and
our party particularly stupid, she was so good as to conceive a violent
partiality for me, which very soon settled in a downright Freindship and ended
in an established correspondence. She is probably by this time as tired of me,
as I am of her; but as she is too Polite and I am too civil to say so, our
letters are still as frequent and affectionate as ever, and our Attachment as
firm and sincere as when it first commenced. As she had a great taste for the
pleasures of London, and of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some
difficulty in prevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say
she feels of beholding you, at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts
of Dissipation, for the melancholy tho&rsquo; venerable gloom of the castle you
inhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much
amusement, she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey to
Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her health, if not
conducive to her happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say, concerning your
father&rsquo;s extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers Jewels and your
Sister&rsquo;s consequence, I should suppose are but too well founded. My
freind herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably spend nearly as much
every year in Dress and Public places, if she can get it&mdash;she will
certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the manner of living to
which he has been so long accustomed, and there is therefore some reason to
fear that you will be very well off, if you get any fortune at all. The Jewels
I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers, and there is too much reason to
think that she will preside at her Husbands table in preference to his
Daughter. But as so melancholy a subject must necessarily extremely distress
you, I will no longer dwell on it&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
Eloisa&rsquo;s indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a
season of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family since we
came. Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill health of their
little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may imagine that being the only
family with whom we can converse, we are of course on a footing of intimacy
with them; we see them indeed almost every day, and dined with them yesterday.
We spent a very pleasant Day, and had a very good Dinner, tho&rsquo; to be sure
the Veal was terribly underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not
help wishing all dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it&mdash;. A
brother of Mrs Marlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a
good-looking young Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I
tell Eloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all seem to
relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and Cleveland has a
very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not consider <i>myself</i>
as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but to tell you the truth I
never wish to act a more principal part at a Wedding than the superintending
and directing the Dinner, and therefore while I can get any of my acquaintance
to marry for me, I shall never think of doing it myself, as I very much suspect
that I should not have so much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for
dressing that of my freinds.

LETTER the FIFTH<br/>
Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Lesley-Castle March 18th
</p>

<p>
On the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received one
from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us that he should
do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on the following
evening. This as you may suppose considerably surprised us, particularly as
your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to imagine there was little
chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that London must be so gay. As it was
our business however to be delighted at such a mark of condescension as a visit
from Sir George and Lady Lesley, we prepared to return them an answer
expressive of the happiness we enjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when
luckily recollecting that as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it
would be impossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh, we
contented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy as we
ought to be. At nine in the Evening on the following day, they came,
accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers. Her Ladyship perfectly answers the
description you sent me of her, except that I do not think her so pretty as you
seem to consider her. She has not a bad face, but there is something so
extremely unmajestic in her little diminutive figure, as to render her in
comparison with the elegant height of Matilda and Myself, an insignificant
Dwarf. Her curiosity to see us (which must have been great to bring her more
than four hundred miles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins to
mention their return to town, and has desired us to accompany her. We cannot
refuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our Father, and
thirded by the entreaties of Mr. Fitzgerald who is certainly one of the most
pleasing young Men, I ever beheld. It is not yet determined when we are to go,
but when ever we do we shall certainly take our little Louisa with us. Adeiu my
dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best wishes to you, and Eloisa, with yours
ever

LETTER the SIXTH<br/>
LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Lesley-Castle March 20th
</p>

<p>
We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already heartily
repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square for such a dismal
old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no idea sufficiently hideous,
of its dungeon-like form. It is actually perched upon a Rock to appearance so
totally inaccessible, that I expected to have been pulled up by a rope; and
sincerely repented having gratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the
expence of being obliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a
manner. But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of this
tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my spirits
revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss Lesleys had
been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again, I met with nothing but
Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and Margaret Lesley are two great, tall,
out of the way, over-grown, girls, just of a proper size to inhabit a Castle
almost as large in comparison as themselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you
could but behold these Scotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of
your wits. They will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to
accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight. Besides
these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who I beleive is
some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave me a long rigmerole
story of her father and a Miss <i>Somebody</i> which I have entirely forgot. I
hate scandal and detest Children. I have been plagued ever since I came here
with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch wretches, with terrible
hard-names; they were so civil, gave me so many invitations, and talked of
coming again so soon, that I could not help affronting them. I suppose I shall
not see them any more, and yet as a family party we are so stupid, that I do
not know what to do with myself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no
Drawings but Scotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems&mdash;and I hate
everything Scotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a
great deal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there is not a
creature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have just had a
conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me, and which as
I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you the particulars
of. You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past strongly suspected
William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest Daughter. I own indeed that
had <i>I</i> been inclined to fall in love with any woman, I should not have
made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object of my passion; for there is
nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but however there is no accounting for
some men&rsquo;s taste and as William is himself nearly six feet high, it is
not wonderful that he should be partial to that height. Now as I have a very
great affection for my Brother and should be extremely sorry to see him
unhappy, which I suppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda, as moreover
I know that his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a
fortune, and that Matilda&rsquo;s is entirely dependant on her Father, who will
neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her anything at
present, I thought it would be doing a good-natured action by my Brother to let
him know as much, in order that he might choose for himself, whether to conquer
his passion, or Love and Despair. Accordingly finding myself this Morning alone
with him in one of the horrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause to
him in the following Manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well my dear William what do you think of these girls? for my part, I do
not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me partial to
the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right&mdash;They are indeed so
very like Sir George that it is natural to think&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do not
really think they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is so very
plain!&mdash;but I beg your pardon&mdash;I had entirely forgotten to whom I was
speaking&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is
horribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with
respect to Sir George and his Daughters. You cannot think your Husband so
deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see any
resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion perfectly
unlike him and perfectly Handsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no
proof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and very
handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very
plain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very
unpleasing in a Man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be
very plain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex.&rdquo; (said he).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, (said he) we will not dispute about <i>his</i> Beauty, but
your opinion of his <i>Daughters</i> is surely very singular, for if I
understood you right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected
to do!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, do <i>you</i> find them plainer then?&rdquo; (said I).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak of
their persons in so extroidinary a Manner. Do not you think the Miss Lesleys
are two very handsome young Women?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord! No! (cried I) I think them terribly plain!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so! Why what
single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly find fault
with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! trust me for that; (replied I). Come I will begin with the
eldest&mdash;with Matilda. Shall I, William?&rdquo; (I looked as cunning as I
could when I said it, in order to shame him).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of
one, would be the faults of both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are <i>taller</i> than you are indeed.&rdquo; (said he with a saucy
smile.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, (said I), I know nothing of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but (he continued) tho&rsquo; they may be above the common size,
their figures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are
beautifull.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least
degree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never could
strain my neck enough to look at them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in not
attempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Certainly. (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure you
my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho&rsquo; by what
followed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given me just
cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he said) &ldquo;You
must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Offended me! Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head!
(returned I) No really! I assure you that I am not in the least surprised at
your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these girls.&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet concluded
our dispute concerning them. What fault do you find with their
complexion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are so horridly pale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is
considerably heightened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of the
world, they will never be able raise more than their common stock&mdash;except
indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down these horrid old
galleries and Antichambers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an
impertinent look at me) if they <i>have</i> but little colour, at least, it is
all their own.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was too much my dear Charlotte, for I am certain that he had the impudence
by that look, of pretending to suspect the reality of mine. But you I am sure
will vindicate my character whenever you may hear it so cruelly aspersed, for
you can witness how often I have protested against wearing Rouge, and how much
I always told you I disliked it. And I assure you that my opinions are still
the same.&mdash;. Well, not bearing to be so suspected by my Brother, I left
the room immediately, and have been ever since in my own Dressing-room writing
to you. What a long letter have I made of it! But you must not expect to
receive such from me when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that
one has time to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.&mdash;. I was so much
vexed by William&rsquo;s glance, that I could not summon Patience enough, to
stay and give him that advice respecting his attachment to Matilda which had
first induced me from pure Love to him to begin the conversation; and I am now
so thoroughly convinced by it, of his violent passion for her, that I am
certain he would never hear reason on the subject, and I shall there fore give
myself no more trouble either about him or his favourite. Adeiu my dear
girl&mdash;

<h2><a name="link2H_4_0025"></a>
LETTER the SEVENTH<br/>
From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY</h2>

<p>
Bristol the 27th of March
</p>

<p>
I have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this week which
have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are both downright
jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two pretty Women tho&rsquo;
actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same House without falling out
about their faces. Do be convinced that you are both perfectly handsome and say
no more of the Matter. I suppose this letter must be directed to Portman Square
where probably (great as is your affection for Lesley Castle) you will not be
sorry to find yourself. In spite of all that people may say about Green fields
and the Country I was always of opinion that London and its amusements must be
very agreable for a while, and should be very happy could my Mother&rsquo;s
income allow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during Winter. I always
longed particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether the cold Beef there is
cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly suspicion that few people
understand the art of cutting a slice of cold Beef so well as I do: nay it
would be hard if I did not know something of the Matter, for it was a part of
my Education that I took by far the most pains with. Mama always found me
<i>her</i> best scholar, tho&rsquo; when Papa was alive Eloisa was <i>his</i>.
Never to be sure were there two more different Dispositions in the World. We
both loved Reading. <i>She</i> preferred Histories, and I Receipts. She loved
drawing, Pictures, and I drawing Pullets. No one could sing a better song than
she, and no one make a better Pye than I.&mdash;And so it has always continued
since we have been no longer children. The only difference is that all disputes
on the superior excellence of our Employments <i>then</i> so frequent are now
no more. We have for many years entered into an agreement always to admire each
other&rsquo;s works; I never fail listening to <i>her</i> Music, and she is as
constant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till Henry Hervey made
his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his Aunt in our neighbourhood
where she established herself you know about a twelvemonth ago, his visits to
her had been at stated times, and of equal and settled Duration; but on her
removal to the Hall which is within a walk from our House, they became both
more frequent and longer. This as you may suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs
Diana who is a professed enemy to everything which is not directed by Decorum
and Formality, or which bears the least resemblance to Ease and Good-breeding.
Nay so great was her aversion to her Nephews behaviour that I have often heard
her give such hints of it before his face that had not Henry at such times been
engaged in conversation with Eloisa, they must have caught his Attention and
have very much distressed him. The alteration in my Sisters behaviour which I
have before hinted at, now took place. The Agreement we had entered into of
admiring each others productions she no longer seemed to regard, and tho&rsquo;
I constantly applauded even every Country-dance, she played, yet not even a
pidgeon-pye of my making could obtain from her a single word of approbation.
This was certainly enough to put any one in a Passion; however, I was as cool
as a cream-cheese and having formed my plan and concerted a scheme of Revenge,
I was determined to let her have her own way and not even to make her a single
reproach. My scheme was to treat her as she treated me, and tho&rsquo; she
might even draw my own Picture or play Malbrook (which is the only tune I ever
really liked) not to say so much as &ldquo;Thank you Eloisa;&rdquo; tho&rsquo;
I had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played, <i>Bravo</i>,
<i>Bravissimo</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>Da capo</i>, <i>allegretto con
expressione</i>, and <i>Poco presto</i> with many other such outlandish words,
all of them as Eloisa told me expressive of my Admiration; and so indeed I
suppose they are, as I see some of them in every Page of every Music book,
being the sentiments I imagine of the composer.
</p>

<p>
I executed my Plan with great Punctuality. I can not say success, for alas! my
silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease her; on the
contrary she actually said to me one day &ldquo;Well Charlotte, I am very glad
to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous custom of applauding my
Execution on the Harpsichord till you made <i>my</i> head ake, and yourself
hoarse. I feel very much obliged to you for keeping your admiration to
yourself.&rdquo; I never shall forget the very witty answer I made to this
speech. &ldquo;Eloisa (said I) I beg you would be quite at your Ease with
respect to all such fears in future, for be assured that I shall always keep my
admiration to myself and my own pursuits and never extend it to yours.&rdquo;
This was the only very severe thing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have
often felt myself extremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my
feelings public.
</p>

<p>
I suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection for
each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for Miss Burton
could not be so strong tho&rsquo; it might be more violent. You may imagine
therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have him play her such a
trick. Poor girl! she still laments his Death with undiminished constancy,
notwithstanding he has been dead more than six weeks; but some People mind such
things more than others. The ill state of Health into which his loss has thrown
her makes her so weak, and so unable to support the least exertion, that she
has been in tears all this Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs.
Marlowe who with her Husband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this
morning. I am sorry to have them go because they are the only family with whom
we have here any acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure Eloisa
and Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and have therefore
contracted a kind of affection for each other, which does not make Tears so
inexcusable in them as they would be in me. The Marlowes are going to Town;
Cliveland accompanies them; as neither Eloisa nor I could catch him I hope you
or Matilda may have better Luck. I know not when we shall leave Bristol,
Eloisa&rsquo;s spirits are so low that she is very averse to moving, and yet is
certainly by no means mended by her residence here. A week or two will I hope
determine our Measures&mdash;in the mean time believe me
</p>

LETTER the EIGHTH<br/>
Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE</h2>

<p>
Bristol April 4th
</p>

<p>
I feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of your
affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made me of our
Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to me to write to
you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow me, you will find me a very
constant correspondent; I will not say an entertaining one, for you know my
situation suffciently not to be ignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and
I know my own Heart too well not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You
must not expect news for we see no one with whom we are in the least
acquainted, or in whose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect
scandal for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or
inventing it.&mdash;You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy
effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness it once
enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The Possibility of
being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry will be a luxury to me,
and your goodness will not I know refuse to read what it will so much releive
my Heart to write. I once thought that to have what is in general called a
Freind (I mean one of my own sex to whom I might speak with less reserve than
to any other person) independant of my sister would never be an object of my
wishes, but how much was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by two
confidential correspondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and
I hope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that to have some
kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows without
endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished for, when our
acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and the particular
affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first, caused me to
entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being improved on a closer
acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were what my wishes formed you
would be the greatest Happiness I could be capable of enjoying. To find that
such Hopes are realised is a satisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now
almost the only one I can ever experience.&mdash;I feel myself so languid that
I am sure were you with me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I
cannot give you a greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I
know you would wish me to do, whether Absent or Present. I am my dear Emmas
sincere freind

<h2><a name="link2H_4_0027"></a>
LETTER the NINTH<br/>
Mrs MARLOWE to Miss LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Grosvenor Street, April 10th
</p>

<p>
Need I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot give a
greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the Desire I feel that
our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than by setting you so good an
example as I now do in answering it before the end of the week&mdash;. But do
not imagine that I claim any merit in being so punctual; on the contrary I
assure you, that it is a far greater Gratification to me to write to you, than
to spend the Evening either at a Concert or a Ball. Mr Marlowe is so desirous
of my appearing at some of the Public places every evening that I do not like
to refuse him, but at the same time so much wish to remain at Home, that
independant of the Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion of my Time to
my Dear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a letter to write of
spending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you know me well enough to be
sensible, will of itself be a sufficient Inducement (if one is necessary) to my
maintaining with Pleasure a Correspondence with you. As to the subject of your
letters to me, whether grave or merry, if they concern you they must be equally
interesting to me; not but that I think the melancholy Indulgence of your own
sorrows by repeating them and dwelling on them to me, will only encourage and
increase them, and that it will be more prudent in you to avoid so sad a
subject; but yet knowing as I do what a soothing and melancholy Pleasure it
must afford you, I cannot prevail on myself to deny you so great an Indulgence,
and will only insist on your not expecting me to encourage you in it, by my own
letters; on the contrary I intend to fill them with such lively Wit and
enlivening Humour as shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but sorrowfull
countenance of my Eloisa.
</p>

<p>
In the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three freinds
Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have been here. I know
you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the Beauty of three Ladies of whom
you have heard so much. Now, as you are too ill and too unhappy to be vain, I
think I may venture to inform you that I like none of their faces so well as I
do your own. Yet they are all handsome&mdash;Lady Lesley indeed I have seen
before; her Daughters I beleive would in general be said to have a finer face
than her Ladyship, and yet what with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a
little Affectation and a great deal of small-talk, (in each of which she is
superior to the young Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself as many admirers
as the more regular features of Matilda, and Margaret. I am sure you will agree
with me in saying that they can none of them be of a proper size for real
Beauty, when you know that two of them are taller and the other shorter than
ourselves. In spite of this Defect (or rather by reason of it) there is
something very noble and majestic in the figures of the Miss Lesleys, and
something agreably lively in the appearance of their pretty little
Mother-in-law. But tho&rsquo; one may be majestic and the other lively, yet the
faces of neither possess that Bewitching sweetness of my Eloisas, which her
present languor is so far from diminushing. What would my Husband and Brother
say of us, if they knew all the fine things I have been saying to you in this
letter. It is very hard that a pretty woman is never to be told she is so by
any one of her own sex without that person&rsquo;s being suspected to be either
her determined Enemy, or her professed Toad-eater. How much more amiable are
women in that particular! One man may say forty civil things to another without
our supposing that he is ever paid for it, and provided he does his Duty by our
sex, we care not how Polite he is to his own.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments, Charlotte, my Love,
and Eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her Health and Spirits that can
be offered by her affectionate Freind
</p>

<p class="right">
E. Marlowe.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid this letter will be but a poor specimen of my Powers in the witty
way; and your opinion of them will not be greatly increased when I assure you
that I have been as entertaining as I possibly could.

LETTER the TENTH<br/>
From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL</h2>

<p>
Portman Square April 13th
</p>

<p>
M<small>Y DEAR</small> C<small>HARLOTTE</small>
</p>

<p>
We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month, and arrived safely in London
after a Journey of seven Days; I had the pleasure of finding your Letter here
waiting my Arrival, for which you have my grateful Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I
every day more regret the serene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have
left, in exchange for the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted
City. Not that I will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal
Amusements are in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy
them extremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every
appearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy Beings
whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho&rsquo; it is out of my power to
return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for the sufferings of
so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme admiration I meet with,
and my aversion to being so celebrated both in Public, in Private, in Papers,
and in Printshops, that are the reasons why I cannot more fully enjoy, the
Amusements so various and pleasing of London. How often have I wished that I
possessed as little Personal Beauty as you do; that my figure were as
inelegant; my face as unlovely; and my appearance as unpleasing as yours! But
ah! what little chance is there of so desirable an Event; I have had the
small-pox, and must therefore submit to my unhappy fate.
</p>

<p>
I am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has long
disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to require the
most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se&rsquo;night Matilda and I
accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs Kickabout&rsquo;s; we
were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable young Man in the main,
tho&rsquo; perhaps a little singular in his Taste&mdash;He is in love with
Matilda&mdash;. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the Lady of the House
and curtseyed to half a score different people when my Attention was attracted
by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely of his Sex, who at that moment
entered the Room with another Gentleman and Lady. From the first moment I
beheld him, I was certain that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life.
Imagine my surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of
Cleveland&mdash;I instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and
the acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman
and Lady who accompanied him. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The
elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at
once confirmed my attachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he
would have said, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the
cultivated Understanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which
would have shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The
approach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the
Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never
commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh! how inferior are
the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival! Sir
James is one of the most frequent of our Visitors, and is almost always of our
Parties. We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland&mdash;he
is always engaged some where else. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time
I see her by her tiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid!
I live in the hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going
to Lady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will be
Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see little of
Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my poor Fortune where
art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who always makes her appearance
(highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what Delightful Jewels will she be decked
in this evening at Lady Flambeau&rsquo;s! Yet I wonder how she can herself
delight in wearing them; surely she must be sensible of the ridiculous
impropriety of loading her little diminutive figure with such superfluous
ornaments; is it possible that she can not know how greatly superior an elegant
simplicity is to the most studied apparel? Would she but Present them to
Matilda and me, how greatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would
Diamonds be on our fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an
Idea should never have occurred to <i>her</i>. I am sure if I have reflected in
this manner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in
them such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother&rsquo;s Jewels
too! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject&mdash;let me entertain
you with something more pleasing&mdash;Matilda had a letter this morning from
Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples has
turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope&rsquo;s Bulls for annulling his
1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and
Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same sort of affair has befallen
his first wife the worthless Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned
Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and
Distinguished merit. He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have
quite forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours.
He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his
little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally
desirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at Present
very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of time; Fitzgerald
offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such
a scheme&mdash;she owns it would be very agreable. I am certain she likes the
Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few
months both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending us.
Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements
of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. &ldquo;No
(says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel
I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found it did
not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again.&rdquo; So says her
Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or
two, they may accompany us.

<p class="center">
THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND
</p>

<p class="center">
HENRY the 4th
</p>

<p>
Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own satisfaction in
the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and predecessor Richard the
2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the rest of his life to Pomfret
Castle, where he happened to be murdered. It is to be supposed that Henry was
married, since he had certainly four sons, but it is not in my power to inform
the Reader who was his wife. Be this as it may, he did not live for ever, but
falling ill, his son the Prince of Wales came and took away the crown;
whereupon the King made a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to
Shakespear&rsquo;s Plays, and the Prince made a still longer. Things being thus
settled between them the King died, and was succeeded by his son Henry who had
previously beat Sir William Gascoigne.
</p>

<p class="center">
HENRY the 5th
</p>

<p>
This Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and amiable,
forsaking all his dissipated companions, and never thrashing Sir William again.
During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I forget what for. His
Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where he went and fought the famous
Battle of Agincourt. He afterwards married the King&rsquo;s daughter Catherine,
a very agreable woman by Shakespear&rsquo;s account. In spite of all this
however he died, and was succeeded by his son Henry.
</p>

<p class="center">
HENRY the 6th
</p>

<p>
I cannot say much for this Monarch&rsquo;s sense. Nor would I if I could, for
he was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him and the
Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had better read some
other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in this, meaning by it only to
vent my spleen <i>against</i>, and shew my Hatred <i>to</i> all those people
whose parties or principles do not suit with mine, and not to give information.
This King married Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose distresses and misfortunes
were so great as almost to make me who hate her, pity her. It was in this reign
that Joan of Arc lived and made such a <i>row</i> among the English. They
should not have burnt her&mdash;but they did. There were several Battles
between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in which the former (as they ought)
usually conquered. At length they were entirely overcome; The King was
murdered&mdash;The Queen was sent home&mdash;and Edward the 4th ascended the
Throne.
</p>

<p class="center">
EDWARD the 4th
</p>

<p>
This Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which the
Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour in marrying one
Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient proofs. His Wife was
Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman! was afterwards confined in a
Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and Avarice Henry the 7th. One of
Edward&rsquo;s Mistresses was Jane Shore, who has had a play written about her,
but it is a tragedy and therefore not worth reading. Having performed all these
noble actions, his Majesty died, and was succeeded by his son.
</p>

<p class="center">
EDWARD the 5th
</p>

<p>
This unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to draw his
picture. He was murdered by his Uncle&rsquo;s Contrivance, whose name was
Richard the 3rd.
</p>

<p class="center">
RICHARD the 3rd
</p>

<p>
The Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated by
Historians, but as he was a <i>York</i>, I am rather inclined to suppose him a
very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently asserted that he killed
his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been declared that he did
<i>not</i> kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to beleive true; and if
this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he did not kill his Wife, for if
Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York, why might not Lambert Simnel be the
Widow of Richard. Whether innocent or guilty, he did not reign long in peace,
for Henry Tudor E. of Richmond as great a villain as ever lived, made a great
fuss about getting the Crown and having killed the King at the battle of
Bosworth, he succeeded to it.
</p>

<p class="center">
HENRY the 7th
</p>

<p>
This Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of York,
by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right inferior to
hers, tho&rsquo; he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage he had two sons
and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was married to the King of
Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother to one of the first
Characters in the World. But of <i>her</i>, I shall have occasion to speak more
at large in future. The youngest, Mary, married first the King of France and
secondly the D. of Suffolk, by whom she had one daughter, afterwards the Mother
of Lady Jane Grey, who tho&rsquo; inferior to her lovely Cousin the Queen of
Scots, was yet an amiable young woman and famous for reading Greek while other
people were hunting. It was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck
and Lambert Simnel before mentioned made their appearance, the former of whom
was set in the stocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was beheaded with
the Earl of Warwick, and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen. His
Majesty died and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not
being <i>quite</i> so bad as his daughter Elizabeth.
</p>

<p class="center">
HENRY the 8th
</p>

<p>
It would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were not as
well acquainted with the particulars of this King&rsquo;s reign as I am myself.
It will therefore be saving <i>them</i> the task of reading again what they
have read before, and <i>myself</i> the trouble of writing what I do not
perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal Events
which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s
telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that &ldquo;he was come to lay his
bones among them,&rdquo; the reformation in Religion and the King&rsquo;s
riding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is however but
Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely innocent
of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her Beauty, her
Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not to mention her
solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the Charges against her, and
the King&rsquo;s Character; all of which add some confirmation, tho&rsquo;
perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those before alledged in her
favour. Tho&rsquo; I do not profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper
to give some and shall of course make choice of those which it is most
necessary for the Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her
letter to the King was dated on the 6th of May. The Crimes and Cruelties of
this Prince, were too numerous to be mentioned, (as this history I trust has
fully shown;) and nothing can be said in his vindication, but that his
abolishing Religious Houses and leaving them to the ruinous depredations of
time has been of infinite use to the landscape of England in general, which
probably was a principal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a
Man who was of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which
had for ages been established in the Kingdom. His Majesty&rsquo;s 5th Wife was
the Duke of Norfolk&rsquo;s Neice who, tho&rsquo; universally acquitted of the
crimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to have led
an abandoned life before her Marriage&mdash;of this however I have many doubts,
since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the
Queen of Scotland&rsquo;s cause, and who at last fell a victim to it. The Kings
last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected it. He was
succeeded by his only son Edward.
</p>

<p class="center">
EDWARD the 6th
</p>

<p>
As this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father&rsquo;s death,
he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the late King
happening to be of the same opinion, his mother&rsquo;s Brother the Duke of
Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority. This Man was on
the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat of a favourite with me,
tho&rsquo; I would by no means pretend to affirm that he was equal to those
first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or Gilpin. He was beheaded, of
which he might with reason have been proud, had he known that such was the
death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but as it was impossible that he should be
conscious of what had never happened, it does not appear that he felt
particularly delighted with the manner of it. After his decease the Duke of
Northumberland had the care of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his
trust of both so well that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his
daughter in law the Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading
Greek. Whether she really understood that language or whether such a study
proceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was always
rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause, she preserved the
same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what was generally esteemed
pleasure, during the whole of her life, for she declared herself displeased
with being appointed Queen, and while conducting to the scaffold, she wrote a
sentence in Latin and another in Greek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband
accidentally passing that way.
</p>

<p class="center">
MARY
</p>

<p>
This woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England, in
spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her Cousins Mary Queen
of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the misfortunes they
experienced during her Reign, since they fully deserved them, for having
allowed her to succeed her Brother&mdash;which was a double peice of folly,
since they might have foreseen that as she died without children, she would be
succeeded by that disgrace to humanity, that pest of society, Elizabeth. Many
were the people who fell martyrs to the protestant Religion during her reign; I
suppose not fewer than a dozen. She married Philip King of Spain who in her
sister&rsquo;s reign was famous for building Armadas. She died without issue,
and then the dreadful moment came in which the destroyer of all comfort, the
deceitful Betrayer of trust reposed in her, and the Murderess of her Cousin
succeeded to the Throne.&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="center">
ELIZABETH
</p>

<p>
It was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad Ministers&mdash;Since
wicked as she herself was, she could not have committed such extensive
mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men connived at, and encouraged her
in her Crimes. I know that it has by many people been asserted and beleived
that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the rest of those who filled
the cheif offices of State were deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But
oh! how blinded such writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit
despised, neglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they
reflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their Country
and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining for the space of
nineteen years, a <i>Woman</i> who if the claims of Relationship and Merit were
of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who condescended to place confidence in
her, had every reason to expect assistance and protection; and at length in
allowing Elizabeth to bring this amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and
scandalous Death. Can any one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot,
this everlasting blot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any
praise to Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this
bewitching Princess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose
only ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was abandoned
by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and vilified by all,
what must not her most noble mind have suffered when informed that Elizabeth
had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore it with a most unshaken fortitude,
firm in her mind; constant in her Religion; and prepared herself to meet the
cruel fate to which she was doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed
from conscious Innocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible
that some hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that
steadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so much credit?
But this is a striking proof of <i>their</i> narrow souls and prejudiced
Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great Hall at Fortheringay
Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of February 1586&mdash;to the
everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of England in general. It
may not be unnecessary before I entirely conclude my account of this ill-fated
Queen, to observe that she had been accused of several crimes during the time
of her reigning in Scotland, of which I now most seriously do assure my Reader
that she was entirely innocent; having never been guilty of anything more than
Imprudencies into which she was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her
Youth, and her Education. Having I trust by this assurance entirely done away
every Suspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in the Reader&rsquo;s
mind, from what other Historians have written of her, I shall proceed to
mention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. It was about
this time that Sir Francis Drake the first English Navigator who sailed round
the World, lived, to be the ornament of his Country and his profession. Yet
great as he was, and justly celebrated as a sailor, I cannot help foreseeing
that he will be equalled in this or the next Century by one who tho&rsquo; now
but young, already promises to answer all the ardent and sanguine expectations
of his Relations and Freinds, amongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom
this work is dedicated, and my no less amiable self.
</p>

<p>
Though of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of Life,
yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an <i>Earl</i>, as Drake was in
that of a <i>Sailor</i>, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This unfortunate young
Man was not unlike in character to that equally unfortunate one <i>Frederic
Delamere</i>. The simile may be carried still farther, and Elizabeth the
torment of Essex may be compared to the Emmeline of Delamere. It would be
endless to recount the misfortunes of this noble and gallant Earl. It is
sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the 25th of Feb, after having been
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having clapped his hand on his sword, and
after performing many other services to his Country. Elizabeth did not long
survive his loss, and died so miserable that were it not an injury to the
memory of Mary I should pity her.
</p>

<p class="center">
JAMES the 1st
</p>

<p>
Though this King had some faults, among which and as the most principal, was
his allowing his Mother&rsquo;s death, yet considered on the whole I cannot
help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and had several Children;
fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before his father or he
might have experienced the evils which befell his unfortunate Brother.
</p>

<p>
As I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with infinite
regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member of it: yet Truth
being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am necessitated to say that in
this reign the roman Catholics of England did not behave like Gentlemen to the
protestants. Their Behaviour indeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of
Parliament might justly be considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir
Henry Percy tho&rsquo; certainly the best bred man of the party, had none of
that general politeness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions
were entirely confined to Lord Mounteagle.
</p>

<p>
Sir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is by many
people held in great veneration and respect&mdash;But as he was an enemy of the
noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and must refer all those
who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars of his life, to Mr
Sheridan&rsquo;s play of the Critic, where they will find many interesting
anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir Christopher Hatton.&mdash;His
Majesty was of that amiable disposition which inclines to Freindship, and in
such points was possessed of a keener penetration in discovering Merit than
many other people. I once heard an excellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the
subject I am now on reminds me, and as I think it may afford my Readers some
amusement to <i>find it out</i>, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it
to them.
</p>

<p class="center">
SHARADE
</p>

<p>
My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you tread on my
whole.
</p>

<p>
The principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was afterwards created
Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share in the above
mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of Buckingham. On his
Majesty&rsquo;s death he was succeeded by his son Charles.
</p>

<p class="center">
CHARLES the 1st
</p>

<p>
This amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to those of
his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve since he was her
descendant. Never certainly were there before so many detestable Characters at
one time in England as in this Period of its History; never were amiable men so
scarce. The number of them throughout the whole Kingdom amounting only to
<i>five</i>, besides the inhabitants of Oxford who were always loyal to their
King and faithful to his interests. The names of this noble five who never
forgot the duty of the subject, or swerved from their attachment to his
Majesty, were as follows&mdash;The King himself, ever stedfast in his own
support&mdash;Archbishop Laud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke
of Ormond, who were scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause. While the
<i>villains</i> of the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I
shall therefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.
Cromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the original Causers
of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in which England for many
years was embroiled. In this reign as well as in that of Elizabeth, I am
obliged in spite of my attachment to the Scotch, to consider them as equally
guilty with the generality of the English, since they dared to think
differently from their Sovereign, to forget the Adoration which as
<i>Stuarts</i> it was their Duty to pay them, to rebel against, dethrone and
imprison the unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to deceive, and to sell the no less
unfortunate Charles. The Events of this Monarch&rsquo;s reign are too numerous
for my pen, and indeed the recital of any Events (except what I make myself) is
uninteresting to me; my principal reason for undertaking the History of England
being to Prove the innocence of the Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself
with having effectually done, and to abuse Elizabeth, tho&rsquo; I am rather
fearful of having fallen short in the latter part of my scheme.&mdash;As
therefore it is not my intention to give any particular account of the
distresses into which this King was involved through the misconduct and Cruelty
of his Parliament, I shall satisfy myself with vindicating him from the
Reproach of Arbitrary and tyrannical Government with which he has often been
charged. This, I feel, is not difficult to be done, for with one argument I am
certain of satisfying every sensible and well disposed person whose opinions
have been properly guided by a good Education&mdash;and this Argument is that
he was a STUART.

LETTER the FIRST<br/>
From a MOTHER to her FREIND.</h2>

<p>
My Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner from that
in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now arrived at that age
when it is necessary for them in some measure to become conversant with the
World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister scarcely a twelvemonth younger. I
flatter myself that their education has been such as will not disgrace their
appearance in the World, and that <i>they</i> will not disgrace their Education
I have every reason to beleive. Indeed they are sweet Girls&mdash;. Sensible
yet unaffected&mdash;Accomplished yet Easy&mdash;. Lively yet Gentle&mdash;. As
their progress in every thing they have learnt has been always the same, I am
willing to forget the difference of age, and to introduce them together into
Public. This very Evening is fixed on as their first <i>entrée</i> into Life,
as we are to drink tea with Mrs Cope and her Daughter. I am glad that we are to
meet no one, for my Girls sake, as it would be awkward for them to enter too
wide a Circle on the very first day. But we shall proceed by
degrees.&mdash;Tomorrow Mr Stanly&rsquo;s family will drink tea with us, and
perhaps the Miss Phillips&rsquo;s will meet them. On Tuesday we shall pay
Morning Visits&mdash;On Wednesday we are to dine at Westbrook. On Thursday we
have Company at home. On Friday we are to be at a Private Concert at Sir John
Wynna&rsquo;s&mdash;and on Saturday we expect Miss Dawson to call in the
Morning&mdash;which will complete my Daughters Introduction into Life. How they
will bear so much dissipation I cannot imagine; of their spirits I have no
fear, I only dread their health.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
This mighty affair is now happily over, and my Girls <i>are out</i>. As the
moment approached for our departure, you can have no idea how the sweet
Creatures trembled with fear and expectation. Before the Carriage drove to the
door, I called them into my dressing-room, and as soon as they were seated thus
addressed them. &ldquo;My dear Girls the moment is now arrived when I am to
reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours towards you during your
Education. You are this Evening to enter a World in which you will meet with
many wonderfull Things; Yet let me warn you against suffering yourselves to be
meanly swayed by the Follies and Vices of others, for beleive me my beloved
Children that if you do&mdash;I shall be very sorry for it.&rdquo; They both
assured me that they would ever remember my advice with Gratitude, and follow
it with attention; That they were prepared to find a World full of things to
amaze and to shock them: but that they trusted their behaviour would never give
me reason to repent the Watchful Care with which I had presided over their
infancy and formed their Minds&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;With such expectations and
such intentions (cried I) I can have nothing to fear from you&mdash;and can
chearfully conduct you to Mrs Cope&rsquo;s without a fear of your being seduced
by her Example, or contaminated by her Follies. Come, then my Children (added
I) the Carriage is driving to the door, and I will not a moment delay the
happiness you are so impatient to enjoy.&rdquo; When we arrived at Warleigh,
poor Augusta could scarcely breathe, while Margaret was all Life and Rapture.
&ldquo;The long-expected Moment is now arrived (said she) and we shall soon be
in the World.&rdquo;&mdash;In a few Moments we were in Mrs Cope&rsquo;s
parlour, where with her daughter she sate ready to receive us. I observed with
delight the impression my Children made on them&mdash;. They were indeed two
sweet, elegant-looking Girls, and tho&rsquo; somewhat abashed from the
peculiarity of their situation, yet there was an ease in their Manners and
address which could not fail of pleasing&mdash;. Imagine my dear Madam how
delighted I must have been in beholding as I did, how attentively they observed
every object they saw, how disgusted with some Things, how enchanted with
others, how astonished at all! On the whole however they returned in raptures
with the World, its Inhabitants, and Manners.

LETTER the SECOND<br/>
From a YOUNG LADY crossed in Love to her freind</h2>

<p>
Why should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits? Why should I
feel it more, why should it wound me deeper than those I have experienced
before? Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for
his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our feelings become more acute from
being often wounded? I must suppose my dear Belle that this is the Case, since
I am not conscious of being more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to
Neville, Fitzowen, or either of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the
most lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman&rsquo;s heart. Tell me then
dear Belle why I still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I weep
when I behold his Bride, for too surely this is the case&mdash;. My Freinds are
all alarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want of
spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my melancholy,
by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited several of their
freinds to spend the Christmas with us. Lady Bridget Darkwood and her
sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and Colonel Seaton&rsquo;s
family will be with us next week. This is all most kindly meant by my Uncle and
Cousins; but what can the presence of a dozen indefferent people do to me, but
weary and distress me&mdash;. I will not finish my Letter till some of our
Visitors are arrived.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Friday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet sister
Miss Jane&mdash;. Although I have been acquainted with this charming Woman
above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she is. She is now
about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is more blooming than I
ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her, the moment she entered the
house, and she appeared equally pleased with me, attaching herself to me during
the remainder of the day. There is something so sweet, so mild in her
Countenance, that she seems more than Mortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching
as her appearance; I could not help telling her how much she engaged my
admiration&mdash;. &ldquo;Oh! Miss Jane (said I)&mdash;and stopped from an
inability at the moment of expressing myself as I could wish&mdash;Oh! Miss
Jane&mdash;(I repeated)&mdash;I could not think of words to suit my
feelings&mdash;She seemed waiting for my speech&mdash;. I was
confused&mdash;distressed&mdash;my thoughts were bewildered&mdash;and I could
only add&mdash;&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; She saw and felt for my
Embarrassment and with admirable presence of mind releived me from it by
saying&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Sophia be not uneasy at having exposed
yourself&mdash;I will turn the Conversation without appearing to notice it.
&ldquo;Oh! how I loved her for her kindness!&rdquo; Do you ride as much as you
used to do?&rdquo; said she&mdash;. &ldquo;I am advised to ride by my
Physician. We have delightful Rides round us, I have a Charming horse, am
uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied I quite recovered from my Confusion,
and in short I ride a great deal.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are in the right my
Love,&rdquo; said she. Then repeating the following line which was an extempore
and equally adapted to recommend both Riding and Candour&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ride where you may, Be Candid where you can,&rdquo; she added,&rdquo;
<i>I</i> rode once, but it is many years ago&mdash;She spoke this in so low and
tremulous a Voice, that I was silent&mdash;. Struck with her Manner of speaking
I could make no reply. &ldquo;I have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes
on my face, since I was married.&rdquo; I was never so
surprised&mdash;&ldquo;Married, Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;You may
well wear that look of astonishment, said she, since what I have said must
appear improbable to you&mdash;Yet nothing is more true than that I once was
married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why are you called Miss Jane?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I married, my Sophia without the consent or knowledge of my father the
late Admiral Annesley. It was therefore necessary to keep the secret from him
and from every one, till some fortunate opportunity might offer of revealing
it&mdash;. Such an opportunity alas! was but too soon given in the death of my
dear Capt. Dashwood&mdash;Pardon these tears, continued Miss Jane wiping her
Eyes, I owe them to my Husband&rsquo;s memory. He fell my Sophia, while
fighting for his Country in America after a most happy Union of seven
years&mdash;. My Children, two sweet Boys and a Girl, who had constantly
resided with my Father and me, passing with him and with every one as the
Children of a Brother (tho&rsquo; I had ever been an only Child) had as yet
been the comforts of my Life. But no sooner had I lossed my Henry, than these
sweet Creatures fell sick and died&mdash;. Conceive dear Sophia what my
feelings must have been when as an Aunt I attended my Children to their early
Grave&mdash;. My Father did not survive them many weeks&mdash;He died, poor
Good old man, happily ignorant to his last hour of my Marriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But did not you own it, and assume his name at your husband&rsquo;s
death?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; I could not bring myself to do it; more especially when in my
Children I lost all inducement for doing it. Lady Bridget, and yourself are the
only persons who are in the knowledge of my having ever been either Wife or
Mother. As I could not Prevail on myself to take the name of Dashwood (a name
which after my Henry&rsquo;s death I could never hear without emotion) and as I
was conscious of having no right to that of Annesley, I dropt all thoughts of
either, and have made it a point of bearing only my Christian one since my
Father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; She paused&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! my dear Miss Jane
(said I) how infinitely am I obliged to you for so entertaining a story! You
cannot think how it has diverted me! But have you quite done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry&rsquo;s elder Brother
dieing about the same time, Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself, and as we
had always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we had
ever been spoken of, though we had never met, we determined to live together.
We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post, so exactly did
our feeling and our actions coincide! We both eagerly embraced the proposals we
gave and received of becoming one family, and have from that time lived
together in the greatest affection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And is this all? said I, I hope you have not done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I have; and did you ever hear a story more pathetic?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never did&mdash;and it is for that reason it pleases me so much, for
when one is unhappy nothing is so delightful to one&rsquo;s sensations as to
hear of equal misery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! but my Sophia why <i>are you</i> unhappy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you not heard Madam of Willoughby&rsquo;s Marriage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But my love why lament <i>his</i> perfidy, when you bore so well that of
many young Men before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Madam, I was used to it then, but when Willoughby broke his
Engagements I had not been dissapointed for half a year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Girl!&rdquo; said Miss Jane.

<h2><a name="link2H_4_0035"></a>
LETTER the THIRD<br/>
From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her freind</h2>

<p>
A few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As my Mother
never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who did me the
honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit forwards, which
is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially as I know it is
considered as confering a great obligation on me &ldquo;So Miss Maria (said her
Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the Carriage) you seem very
smart to night&mdash;<i>My</i> poor Girls will appear quite to disadvantage by
<i>you</i>&mdash;I only hope your Mother may not have distressed herself to
set <i>you</i> off. Have you got a new Gown on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; replied I with as much indifference as I could
assume.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, and a fine one too I think&mdash;(feeling it, as by her permission
I seated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart&mdash;But I must own,
for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a needless piece
of expence&mdash;Why could not you have worn your old striped one? It is not my
way to find fault with People because they are poor, for I always think that
they are more to be despised and pitied than blamed for it, especially if they
cannot help it, but at the same time I must say that in my opinion your old
striped Gown would have been quite fine enough for its Wearer&mdash;for to tell
you the truth (I always speak my mind) I am very much afraid that one half of
the people in the room will not know whether you have a Gown on or
not&mdash;But I suppose you intend to make your fortune to night&mdash;. Well,
the sooner the better; and I wish you success.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed Ma&rsquo;am I have no such intention&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter?&rdquo;
Miss Greville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was your Mother gone to bed before you left her?&rdquo; said her
Ladyship.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Ma&rsquo;am, said Ellen it is but nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be
extravagant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was just sitting down to supper Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what had she got for supper?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did not observe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bread and Cheese I suppose.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should never wish for a
better supper.&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;You have never any reason replied her
Mother, as a better is always provided for you.&rdquo; Miss Greville laughed
excessively, as she constantly does at her Mother&rsquo;s wit.
</p>

<p>
Such is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while riding
in her Ladyship&rsquo;s Coach&mdash;I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother is
always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my way in the
world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady Greville, or you
may be certain that I would never enter either her House, or her Coach with the
disagreable certainty I always have of being abused for my Poverty while I am
in them.&mdash;When we arrived at Ashburnham, it was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock,
which was an hour and a half later than we were desired to be there; but Lady
Greville is too fashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The
Dancing however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been
long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just as we
were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got his white
Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean time the Dancing
began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went exactly before
me&mdash;She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though there were
several people close to us,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey day, Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner? Poor Young Lady! I
am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing. But do not despair; perhaps you
may get a hop before the Evening is over.&rdquo; So saying, she passed on
without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and leaving me very
much provoked at being so exposed before every one&mdash;Mr Bernard however
soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered the room, and leading
me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared from the imputation Lady
Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all the old Ladies who had heard her
speech. I soon forgot all my vexations in the pleasure of dancing and of having
the most agreable partner in the room. As he is moreover heir to a very large
Estate I could see that Lady Greville did not look very well pleased when she
found who had been his Choice&mdash;She was determined to mortify me, and
accordingly when we were sitting down between the dances, she came to me with
<i>more</i> than her usual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and said
loud enough to be heard by half the people in the room, &ldquo;Pray Miss Maria
in what way of business was your Grandfather? for Miss Mason and I cannot agree
whether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder.&rdquo; I saw that she wanted to
mortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent her seeing that her
scheme succeeded. &ldquo;Neither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aye, I knew he was in some such low way&mdash;He broke did not
he?&rdquo; &ldquo;I beleive not Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did not he
abscond?&rdquo; &ldquo;I never heard that he did.&rdquo; &ldquo;At least he
died insolvent?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was never told so before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,
was not your <i>Father</i> as poor as a Rat&rdquo; &ldquo;I fancy not.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Was not he in the Kings Bench once?&rdquo; &ldquo;I never saw him
there.&rdquo; She gave me <i>such</i> a look, and turned away in a great
passion; while I was half delighted with myself for my impertinence, and half
afraid of being thought too saucy. As Lady Greville was extremely angry with
me, she took no further notice of me all the Evening, and indeed had I been in
favour I should have been equally neglected, as she was got into a Party of
great folks and she never speaks to me when she can to anyone else. Miss
Greville was with her Mother&rsquo;s party at supper, but Ellen preferred
staying with the Bernards and me. We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady
G&mdash;slept all the way home, I had a very comfortable ride.
</p>

<p>
The next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville&rsquo;s Coach stopped at the
door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should. She sent
in a message by the servant to say that &ldquo;she should not get out but that
Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she wanted to speak to her, and that
she must make haste and come immediately&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;What an
impertinent Message Mama!&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;Go Maria&mdash;&rdquo;
replied she&mdash;Accordingly I went and was obliged to stand there at her
Ladyships pleasure though the Wind was extremely high and very cold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last
night&mdash;But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that you
may dine with us the day after tomorrow&mdash;Not tomorrow, remember, do not
come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas
Stanley&rsquo;s family&mdash;There will be no occasion for your being very fine
for I shant send the Carriage&mdash;If it rains you may take an
umbrella&mdash;&rdquo; I could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me
leave to keep myself dry&mdash;&ldquo;And pray remember to be in time, for I
shant wait&mdash;I hate my Victuals over-done&mdash;But you need not come
before the time&mdash;How does your Mother do? She is at dinner is not
she?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am we were in the middle of dinner when your
Ladyship came.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am afraid you find it very cold Maria.&rdquo;
said Ellen. &ldquo;Yes, it is an horrible East wind&mdash;said her
Mother&mdash;I assure you I can hardly bear the window down&mdash;But you are
used to be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your
Complexion so rudely and coarse. You young Ladies who cannot often ride in a
Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the wind shews your
legs. I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do in such a day as
this. But some sort of people have no feelings either of cold or
Delicacy&mdash;Well, remember that we shall expect you on Thursday at 5
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;You must tell your Maid to come for you at
night&mdash;There will be no Moon&mdash;and you will have an horrid walk
home&mdash;My compts to Your Mother&mdash;I am afraid your dinner will be
cold&mdash;Drive on&mdash;&rdquo; And away she went, leaving me in a great
passion with her as she always does.

LETTER the FOURTH<br/>
From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind</h2>

<p>
We dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very agreable
looking Girl his Cousin. I was extremely pleased with her appearance, for added
to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and voice had something
peculiarly interesting in them. So much so, that they inspired me with a great
curiosity to know the history of her Life, who were her Parents, where she came
from, and what had befallen her, for it was then only known that she was a
relation of Mr Evelyn, and that her name was Grenville. In the evening a
favourable opportunity offered to me of attempting at least to know what I
wished to know, for every one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr
Drayton, Miss Grenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged in a
whispering Conversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of necessity
obliged to entertain each other. This was what I wished and being determined
not to remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began the Conversation in the
following Manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you been long in Essex Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I arrived on Tuesday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You came from Derbyshire?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Ma&rsquo;am! appearing surprised at my question, from
Suffolk.&rdquo; You will think this a good dash of mine my dear Mary, but you
know that I am not wanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw.
&ldquo;Are you pleased with the Country Miss Grenville? Do you find it equal to
the one you have left?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much superior Ma&rsquo;am in point of Beauty.&rdquo; She sighed. I
longed to know for why.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a poor
consolation for the loss of one&rsquo;s dearest Freinds.&rdquo; She shook her
head, as if she felt the truth of what I said. My Curiosity was so much raised,
that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed
I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;You were born there I suppose?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes
Ma&rsquo;am I was and passed many happy years there&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a great comfort&mdash;said I&mdash;I hope Ma&rsquo;am that you
never spent any <i>un</i>happy one&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a right
to expect uninterrupted Happiness.&mdash;<i>Some</i> Misfortunes I have
certainly met with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>What</i> Misfortunes dear Ma&rsquo;am? replied I, burning with
impatience to know every thing. &ldquo;<i>None</i> Ma&rsquo;am I hope that have
been the effect of any wilfull fault in me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare say not
Ma&rsquo;am, and have no doubt but that any sufferings you may have experienced
could arise only from the cruelties of Relations or the Errors of
Freinds.&rdquo; She sighed&mdash;&ldquo;You seem unhappy my dear Miss
Grenville&mdash;Is it in my power to soften your Misfortunes?&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Your</i> power Ma&rsquo;am replied she extremely surprised; it is in
<i>no ones</i> power to make me happy.&rdquo; She pronounced these words in so
mournfull and solemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage to reply.
I was actually silenced. I recovered myself however in a few moments and
looking at her with all the affection I could, &ldquo;My dear Miss Grenville
said I, you appear extremely young&mdash;and may probably stand in need of some
one&rsquo;s advice whose regard for you, joined to superior Age, perhaps
superior Judgement might authorise her to give it. I am that person, and I now
challenge you to accept the offer I make you of my Confidence and Freindship,
in return to which I shall only ask for yours&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are extremely obliging Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;said she&mdash;and I am
highly flattered by your attention to me&mdash;But I am in no difficulty, no
doubt, no uncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted. Whenever
I am however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile, I shall know
where to apply.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I bowed, but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still however I had
not given up my point. I found that by the appearance of sentiment and
Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to renew my
attacks by Questions and suppositions. &ldquo;Do you intend staying long in
this part of England Miss Grenville?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am, some time I beleive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are neither of them alive Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; This was an answer I
did not expect&mdash;I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my
Life&mdash;.

LETTER the FIFTH<br/>
From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind</h2>

<p>
My Uncle gets more stingy, my Aunt more particular, and I more in love every
day. What shall we all be at this rate by the end of the year! I had this
morning the happiness of receiving the following Letter from my dear Musgrove.
</p>

<p class="right">
Sackville St: Janry 7th
</p>

<p>
It is a month to day since I first beheld my lovely
Henrietta, and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in a manner
becoming the day&mdash;by writing to her. Never shall I forget the moment when
her Beauties first broke on my sight&mdash;No time as you well know can erase
it from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady Scudamore to live
within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first entered
the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight of you was like the sight ofa
wonderful fine Thing. I started&mdash;I gazed at her with admiration&mdash;She
appeared every moment more Charming, and the unfortunate Musgrove became a
captive to your Charms before I had time to look about me. Yes Madam, I had the
happiness of adoring you, an happiness for which I cannot be too grateful.
&ldquo;What said he to himself is Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta?
Enviable Mortal! and may he pine for her who is the object of universal
admiration, who is adored by a Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable
Henrietta how beautiful you are! I declare you are quite divine! You are more
than Mortal. You are an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are
the prettiest Girl I ever saw in my Life&mdash;and her Beauty is encreased in
her Musgroves Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope. And
ah! Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do hope for the
death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since my fair one will
not consent to be mine till their decease has placed her in affluence above
what my fortune can procure&mdash;. Though it is an improvable Estate&mdash;.
Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I am at Present with my sister
where I mean to continue till my own house which tho&rsquo; an excellent one is
at Present somewhat out of repair, is ready to receive me. Amiable princess of
my Heart farewell&mdash;Of that Heart which trembles while it signs itself Your
most ardent Admirer and devoted humble servt.
</p>

<p class="right">
T. Musgrove.
</p>

<p>
There is a pattern for a Love-letter Matilda! Did you ever read such a
master-piece of Writing? Such sense, such sentiment, such purity of Thought,
such flow of Language and such unfeigned Love in one sheet? No, never I can
answer for it, since a Musgrove is not to be met with by every Girl. Oh! how I
long to be with him! I intend to send him the following in answer to his Letter
tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
My dearest Musgrove&mdash;. Words cannot express how happy your Letter made me;
I thought I should have cried for joy, for I love you better than any body in
the World. I think you the most amiable, and the handsomest Man in England, and
so to be sure you are. I never read so sweet a Letter in my Life. Do write me
another just like it, and tell me you are in love with me in every other line.
I quite die to see you. How shall we manage to see one another? for we are so
much in love that we cannot live asunder. Oh! my dear Musgrove you cannot think
how impatiently I wait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt&mdash;If they will
not Die soon, I beleive I shall run mad, for I get more in love with you every
day of my Life.
</p>

<p>
How happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her house,
and how happy every body in London must be because you are there. I hope you
will be so kind as to write to me again soon, for I never read such sweet
Letters as yours. I am my dearest Musgrove most truly and faithfully yours for
ever and ever
</p>

<p class="right">
Henrietta Halton.
</p>

<p>
I hope he will like my answer; it is as good a one as I can write though
nothing to his; Indeed I had always heard what a dab he was at a Love-letter. I
saw him you know for the first time at Lady Scudamores&mdash;And when I saw her
Ladyship afterwards she asked me how I liked her Cousin Musgrove?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why upon my word said I, I think he is a very handsome young Man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you think so replied she, for he is distractedly in love with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Law! Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, t&rsquo;is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love
with you from the first moment he beheld you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I would
give a farthing for&mdash;There is some sense in being in love at first
sight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and I
beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a contemptible
one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a great deal of the
World, and writes the best Love-letters I ever read.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This made me very happy, and I was excessively pleased with my conquest.
However, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs&mdash;so I said to
her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young
Ladies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have no
fortune at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much convinced of that as you can
be, and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage your
marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune with you. Mr
Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of several hundreds an
year which is capable of great Improvement, and an excellent House, though at
Present it is not quite in repair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If that is the case replied I, I have nothing more to say against him,
and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a good Love-letter,
I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him for admiring me, tho&rsquo;
perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady Scudamore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her
Ladyship, except that which love himself will dictate to you, for if I am not
greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself, cherishing a
most tender affection for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Law, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a
thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because every look, every word betrays it, answered she; Come my dear
Henrietta, consider me as a freind, and be sincere with me&mdash;Do not you
prefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore, said I turning away my
head, for it is not fit for me to answer them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay my Love replied she, now you confirm my suspicions. But why
Henrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why refuse to
confide in me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage. I do not refuse to
confide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove, that I
am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a handsome Man. If
he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be ashamed of a passion which
must have been mean since the object would have been unworthy. But with such a
figure and face, and such beautiful hair as your Cousin has, why should I blush
to own that such superior merit has made an impression on me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection)
what a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a quick
discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such Noble
Sentiments!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you Ma&rsquo;am said I; You are vastly obliging. But pray Lady
Scudamore did your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like
him the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! my Love replied she, you were born for each other. Every word you
say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the invisible
power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly coincide. Nay,
the colour of your Hair is not very different. Yes my dear Girl, the poor
despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of his Love&mdash;. Nor was I
surprised at it&mdash;I know not how it was, but I had a kind of presentiment
that he <i>would</i> be in love with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, but how did he break it to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was not till after supper. We were sitting round the fire together
talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the Conversation was
cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent, when on a sudden he
interrupted me in the midst of something I was saying, by exclaiming in a most
Theatrical tone&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Yes I&rsquo;m in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion! To make such a
couple of charming lines about me! What a pity it is that they are not in
rhime!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great
deal of Taste in it. And are you in love with her, Cousin? said I. I am very
sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect, with a pretty
Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent House tho&rsquo;
somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with success to the adorable
Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel and been toasted by a
Baronet&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That</i> I have&mdash;&rdquo; cried I. Lady
Scudamore continued. &ldquo;Ah dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced
of the little Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands, that
I need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so. Yet surely neither
you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the exquisite Gratification of
dieing for her, of falling a victim to her Charms. And when I am
dead&rdquo;&mdash;continued her&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature
should talk of dieing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When I am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and
perhaps she may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting
subject. I cannot bear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would not
for Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pray go on.&rdquo; said I. She did so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then added he, Ah! Cousin imagine what my transports will be when I
feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face! Who would not die to haste
such extacy! And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta bless some
happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly attached to her as the
hapless Musgrove and while <i>he</i> crumbles to dust, May they live an example
of Felicity in the Conjugal state!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Did you ever hear any thing so pathetic? What a charming wish, to be lain at my
feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have to be capable of
such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this, must
melt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be; and could the
divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her happiness, all gentle as
is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she would pity your affection and
endeavour to return it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! Cousin answered he, do not endeavour
to raise my hopes by such flattering assurances. No, I cannot hope to please
this angel of a Woman, and the only thing which remains for me to do, is to
die.&rdquo; &ldquo;True Love is ever desponding replied I, but <i>I</i> my dear
Tom will give you even greater hopes of conquering this fair one&rsquo;s heart,
than I have yet given you, by assuring you that I watched her with the
strictest attention during the whole day, and could plainly discover that she
cherishes in her bosom though unknown to herself, a most tender affection for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did not I say that it was unknown to yourself? I did not, continued I to
him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might render the
pleasure still Greater.&rdquo; &ldquo;No Cousin replied he in a languid voice,
nothing will convince me that <i>I</i> can have touched the heart of Henrietta
Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt deceiving me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to Persuade the
poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for him; but when at
last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments, or discredit what I
told him, his transports, his Raptures, his Extacies are beyond my power to
describe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear
Lady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle and
Aunt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I told him every thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what did he say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws
of England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by their
Nephews or Neices, and wished <i>he</i> were in the House of Commons, that he
might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! the sweet Man! What a spirit he has!&rdquo; said I.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta would
condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that splendor to which she
had been used, and accept only in exchange the Comforts and Elegancies which
his limited Income could afford her, even supposing that his house were in
Readiness to receive her. I told him that it could not be expected that she
would; it would be doing her an injustice to suppose her capable of giving up
the power she now possesses and so nobly uses of doing such extensive Good to
the poorer part of her fellow Creatures, merely for the gratification of you
and herself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be sure said I, I <i>am</i> very Charitable every now and then. And
what did Mr Musgrove say to this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He replied that he was under a melancholy necessity of owning the truth
of what I said, and that therefore if he should be the happy Creature destined
to be the Husband of the Beautiful Henrietta he must bring himself to wait,
however impatiently, for the fortunate day, when she might be freed from the
power of worthless Relations and able to bestow herself on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What a noble Creature he is! Oh! Matilda what a fortunate one I am, who am to
be his Wife! My Aunt is calling me to come and make the pies, so adeiu my dear
freind, and beleive me yours etc&mdash;

THE FEMALE PHILOSOPHER</h2>

<h3>A LETTER</h3>

<p>
M<small>Y DEAR</small> L<small>OUISA</small>
</p>

<p>
Your friend Mr Millar called upon us yesterday in his way to Bath, whither he
is going for his health; two of his daughters were with him, but the eldest and
the three Boys are with their Mother in Sussex. Though you have often told me
that Miss Millar was remarkably handsome, you never mentioned anything of her
Sisters&rsquo; beauty; yet they are certainly extremely pretty. I&rsquo;ll give
you their description.&mdash;Julia is eighteen; with a countenance in which
Modesty, Sense and Dignity are happily blended, she has a form which at once
presents you with Grace, Elegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen
is shorter than her Sister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity
of Julia&rsquo;s, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way
as estimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness the
most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking. She appears to
have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her conversation during the
half hour they set with us, was replete with humourous sallies, Bonmots and
repartees; while the sensible, the amiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality
worthy of a heart like her own. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I
had always received of him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that
social Shake, and cordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old
and valued freind from whom thro&rsquo; various circumstances he had been
separated nearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too) that
many events had befallen each during that interval of time, which gave occasion
to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the many changes in
their situation which so long a period had occasioned, on the advantages of
some, and the disadvantages of others. From this subject she made a short
digression to the instability of human pleasures and the uncertainty of their
duration, which led her to observe that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She
was proceeding to illustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great
Men when the Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father
and Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending five or
six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you, and I assure
you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all. &ldquo;Louisa Clarke
(said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet sometimes her good humour is
clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite. She neither wants Understanding or is
without some pretensions to Beauty, but these are so very trifling, that the
value she sets on her personal charms, and the adoration she expects them to be
offered are at once a striking example of her vanity, her pride, and her
folly.&rdquo; So said I, and to my opinion everyone added weight by the
concurrence of their own.

A LETTER from a YOUNG LADY, whose feelings being too strong for her Judgement
led her into the commission of Errors which her Heart disapproved.
</h3>

<p>
Many have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved Ellinor,
and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on a close
examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have strictly deserved them. I
murdered my father at a very early period of my Life, I have since murdered my
Mother, and I am now going to murder my Sister. I have changed my religion so
often that at present I have not an idea of any left. I have been a perjured
witness in every public tryal for these last twelve years; and I have forged my
own Will. In short there is scarcely a crime that I have not
committed&mdash;But I am now going to reform. Colonel Martin of the Horse
guards has paid his Addresses to me, and we are to be married in a few days. As
there is something singular in our Courtship, I will give you an account of it.
Colonel Martin is the second son of the late Sir John Martin who died immensely
rich, but bequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice to his three
younger Children, left the bulk of his fortune, about eight Million to the
present Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the Colonel lived tolerably
contented for nearly four months when he took it into his head to determine on
getting the whole of his eldest Brother&rsquo;s Estate. A new will was forged
and the Colonel produced it in Court&mdash;but nobody would swear to it&rsquo;s
being the right will except himself, and he had sworn so much that Nobody
beleived him. At that moment I happened to be passing by the door of the Court,
and was beckoned in by the Judge who told the Colonel that I was a Lady ready
to witness anything for the cause of Justice, and advised him to apply to me.
In short the Affair was soon adjusted. The Colonel and I swore to its&rsquo;
being the right will, and Sir Thomas has been obliged to resign all his
illgotten wealth. The Colonel in gratitude waited on me the next day with an
offer of his hand&mdash;. I am now going to murder my Sister.

A TOUR THROUGH WALES&mdash;<br/>
in a LETTER from a YOUNG LADY&mdash;</h2>

<p>
M<small>Y DEAR</small> C<small>LARA</small>
</p>

<p>
I have been so long on the ramble that I have not till now had it in my power
to thank you for your Letter&mdash;. We left our dear home on last Monday
month; and proceeded on our tour through Wales, which is a principality
contiguous to England and gives the title to the Prince of Wales. We travelled
on horseback by preference. My Mother rode upon our little poney and Fanny and
I walked by her side or rather ran, for my Mother is so fond of riding fast
that she galloped all the way. You may be sure that we were in a fine
perspiration when we came to our place of resting. Fanny has taken a great many
Drawings of the Country, which are very beautiful, tho&rsquo; perhaps not such
exact resemblances as might be wished, from their being taken as she ran along.
It would astonish you to see all the Shoes we wore out in our Tour. We
determined to take a good Stock with us and therefore each took a pair of our
own besides those we set off in. However we were obliged to have them both
capped and heelpeiced at Carmarthen, and at last when they were quite gone,
Mama was so kind as to lend us a pair of blue Sattin Slippers, of which we each
took one and hopped home from Hereford delightfully&mdash;

A TALE.</h2>

<p>
A Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal, bought a small Cottage in
Pembrokeshire about two years ago. This daring Action was suggested to him by
his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet for him,
provided he would take a small house near the borders of an extensive Forest,
and about three Miles from the Sea. Wilhelminus gladly accepted the offer and
continued for some time searching after such a retreat when he was one morning
agreably releived from his suspence by reading this advertisement in a
Newspaper.
</p>

<p class="center">
T<small>O BE</small> L<small>ETT</small>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and about three Miles from
the Sea. It is ready furnished except two rooms and a Closet.
</p>

<p>
The delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and shewed
him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him in his Carriage
to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for three days and six
nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest and following a track which
led by it&rsquo;s side down a steep Hill over which ten Rivulets meandered,
they reached the Cottage in half an hour. Wilhelminus alighted, and after
knocking for some time without receiving any answer or hearing any one stir
within, he opened the door which was fastened only by a wooden latch and
entered a small room, which he immediately perceived to be one of the two that
were unfurnished&mdash;From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A
pair of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above, no less
destitute, and these apartments he found composed the whole of the House. He
was by no means displeased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of
reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture
himself&mdash;. He returned immediately to his Brother, who took him the next
day to every Shop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the
two rooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and
Wilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage. Robertus accompanied
him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and
Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached, and a large number of
Attendants.&mdash;An ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed, in
endeavouring to accomodate so large a party, but Wilhelminus with admirable
presence of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in
an open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house. Their Construction was both
simple and elegant&mdash;A couple of old blankets, each supported by four
sticks, gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy
ease in overcoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus&rsquo;s most
striking Virtues.
